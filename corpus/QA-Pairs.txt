Healthy sources of carbs include fruits, as well as vegetables, whole grains, legumes (beans), and low-fat dairy foods.

Q: How can I learn to accept my diabetes?
A: Accepting that you have diabetes is largely an act of cognition-a realignment of what you view as real and vital to your existence and how it can impact your life. Diabetes becomes an integral part of a person's life. Accept that diabetes will, for the rest of your life, be there. And it's a very treatable disease, which places few restrictions on you if you follow treatment recommendations.

Q: Will insulin make me gain weight?
A: A: The reason we need insulin-as a hormone made in our bodies or as a medication-is to push glucose into cells for energy. Insulin's job is to process calories. For this reason, it can-but doesn't have to-cause weight gain. To prevent weight gain: Practice portion control. Burn extra calories with exercise. If your blood sugar has been high for a while prior to starting insulin, you've likely been excreting calories in your urine instead of fueling your body. This won't happen once your blood sugar is under control. If you experience hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), treat it with just 15 grams of carb.

Q: Why is weight loss so important? What's the best way for a person with type 2 to lose weight?
A: A: Weight loss is vital, particularly just after a diagnosis of type 2 or prediabetes. Weight loss increases insulin sensitivity, allowing cells to more effectively use the insulin the body continues to make. Losing just 10–20 pounds can accomplish a boatload of benefits. Among them are improved blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels and possibly taking fewer medications or lower doses. To lose weight slowly and steadily, change your lifestyle. The pounds you keep off over time are the most important to living a long life.

Q: Can I drink alcohol?
A: Yes, adults with diabetes can drink alcohol and should follow the same guidelines as the general public-an average of up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men, with no more than three or four drinks in any single day for women and men, respectively.

Q: Can your menstrual cycle and/or going through menopause affect glucose levels?
A: Yes and yes! It's common for women to have hormone fluctuations the week before their period, and those can affect glucose control. After ovulating, estrogen and progesterone rise. 

Q: What are the best foods to eat before and after exercising?
A: Foods that contain carbohydrate are quick and easy to digest for energy. Eat foods like bread, crackers, pretzels, dry cereal, 100 percent fruit juice, or sports drink with calories.

Q: Can I get rid of diabetes? Will it ever go away?
A: Once you are diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, you have it for the rest of your life. To stay healthy, keep your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol under good control. To do so, eat healthy, be physically active, and take your prescribed medications. Also get the tests and checks you need to detect complications early and treat them aggressively.

Q: Is it true that complications of diabetes can be delayed and even prevented?
A: A: Yes! Research shows that the earlier your diabetes is diagnosed and the sooner you start to aggressively get your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol into target ranges, the healthier you can be over the years. To stay healthy and detect any complications early, make sure your health care provider orders all the tests and checks you need. Let your provider know if you have any signs or symptoms of a potential problem. 

Q: How can I get motivated to take care of myself?
A: Make one tiny habit change after another. Experience success, then change another tiny habit, then another. 

Q: How Does Type 2 Diabetes Affect Your Mental Health?
A: Diabetes can affect your mental health, and conversely, your state of mind can affect how well you manage the disease. People with diabetes are 2 to 3 times more likely to experience depression than those who don’t have the condition. Yet only 25 to 50 percent of all people who have diabetes and depression get a mental health diagnosis and treatment.

Q: Where Does Diabetes Rank on the List of Top Causes of Death?
A: Diabetes was the seventh-leading cause of death in the United States in 2019, with about 282,801 death certificates listing it as the underlying cause of death or a contributing cause.right up arrow.

Q: What should I do if I think I have diabetes?
