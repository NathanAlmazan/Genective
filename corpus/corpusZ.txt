what leads to diabetes? type and type 2 diabetes have different causes, but there are two factors that are important in both. you inherit a predisposition to the disease, then something in your environment triggers it. that’s right: genes alone are not enough. one proof of this is identical twins. identical twins have identical genes. yet when one twin has type 1 diabetes, the other gets the disease, at most, only half the time. when one twin has type 2 diabetes, the other's risk is three in four at most. in most cases of type 1 diabetes, people need to inherit risk factors from both parents. we think these factors must be more common in white people because white people have the highest rate of type 1 diabetes. because most people who are at risk do not get diabetes, researchers want to find out what the environmental triggers are. one trigger might be related to cold weather. type 1 diabetes develops more often in winter than summer and is more common in places with cold climates. another trigger might be viruses. it's possible that a virus that has only mild effects on most people triggers type 1 diabetes in others. early diet may also play a role. for example, type 1 diabetes is less common in people who were breastfed and in those who first ate solid foods at later ages. in many people, the development of type 1 diabetes seems to take many years. in experiments that follow relatives of people with type 1 diabetes, researchers have found that most of those who later got diabetes had certain autoantibodies, or proteins that destroy bacteria or viruses (antibodies "gone bad" that attack the body's own tissues), in their blood for years before they are diagnosed. if you are a man with type 1 diabetes, the odds of your child developing diabetes are 1 in 17. if you are a woman with type 1 diabetes and your child was born before you were 25, your child's risk is 1 in 25. if your child was born after you turned 25, your child's risk is 1 in 100. your child's risk is doubled if you developed diabetes before age 11. if both you and your partner have type 1 diabetes, the risk is between 1 in 10 and 1 in 4. there is an exception to these numbers: about one in every seven people with type 1 diabetes has a condition called type 2 polyglandular autoimmune syndrome. in addition to having diabetes, these people also have thyroid disease and a poorly working adrenal gland some also have other immune system disorders. if you have this syndrome, your child's risk of getting the syndrome and developing type 1 diabetes, is one in two. researchers are learning how to predict a person's odds of getting diabetes. for example, most white people with type 1 diabetes have genes called hla-dr3 or hla-dr4, which are linked to autoimmune disease. if you and your child are white and share these genes, your child's risk is higher. suspect genes in other ethnic groups are less well-studied, however, scientists believe the hla-dr7 gene may put african american’s at risk, and the hla-dr9 gene may put japanese people at risk. an antibodies test can be done for children who have siblings with type 1 diabetes. this test measures antibodies to insulin, to is let cells in the pancreas or to an enzyme called glutamic acid decarboxylase (gad). high levels can indicate that a child has a higher risk of developing type 1 diabetes. if you think your child might have type 1 diabetes, contact your doctor. if a member of your family has type 1 diabetes, you may be eligible for a risk screening offered through the trial net pathway to prevention study. trial net risk screening is free to relatives of people with type 1 and uses a simple blood test that can detect your risk of type 1 diabetes years before symptoms appear. if you are in the early stages of type 1 diabetes, you may also be eligible for a prevention study. type 2 diabetes has a stronger link to family history and lineage than type 1, and studies of twins have shown that genetics play a very strong role in the development of type 2 diabetes. race can also play a role. yet it also depends on environmental factors. lifestyle also influences the development of type 2 diabetes. obesity tends to run in families, and families often have similar eating and exercise habits. if you have a family history of type 2 diabetes, it may be difficult to figure out whether your diabetes is due to lifestyle factors or genetics. most likely it is due to both. however, don't lose heart. studies show that it is possible to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes by exercising and losing weight. learn how you can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes. type 2 diabetes runs in families. in part, this is due to children learning bad habits eating a poor diet, not exercising from their parents. but there is also a genetic basis. the good news is, like in adults, it is possible to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes in youth by encouraging healthy food choices, exercise and weight loss. type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic condition that affects the way your body metabolizes sugar (glucose), an important source of fuel for the body. in type 2 diabetes, your body either resists the effects of insulin a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into your cells or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels. what causes type 2 diabetes? the main cause of type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance. insulin resistance happens when cells in your muscles, fat and liver don’t respond as they should to insulin. insulin is a hormone your pancreas makes that’s essential for life and regulating blood sugar levels. if your body isn't responding to insulin properly, your pancreas has to make more insulin to try to overcome your increasing blood glucose levels (hyperinsulinemia). if your cells become too resistant to insulin and your pancreas can’t make enough insulin to overcome it, it leads to type 2 diabetes. several factors can contribute to insulin resistance, including: genetics, excess body fat, especially in your belly and around your organs (visceral fat), physical inactivity, eating highly processed, high-carbohydrate foods and saturated fats frequently, certain medications, like long-term corticosteroid use, hormonal disorders, like hypothyroidism and cushing syndrome, chronic stress and a lack of quality sleep. what is insulin? insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, a gland located behind the stomach. it plays a crucial role in regulating blood sugar (glucose) levels. when you eat, your digestive system breaks down carbohydrates into glucose, which enters the bloodstream. in response to rising blood sugar levels, the pancreas releases insulin. the main functions of insulin include: facilitating glucose uptake: insulin enables cells in the muscles, fat, and liver to absorb glucose from the bloodstream. this allows cells to use glucose for energy. inhibiting glucose production: insulin suppresses the liver's production of glucose. between meals, when blood sugar levels drop, the pancreas reduces insulin secretion, and the liver releases stored glucose to maintain normal blood sugar levels. promoting glycogen synthesis: insulin helps convert excess glucose into glycogen, a form of stored glucose, in the liver and muscles. this stored glycogen can be released when energy is needed. inhibiting fat breakdown: insulin also plays a role in inhibiting the breakdown of fats in fat cells. when insulin levels are high, the body tends to store excess calories as fat. in type 2 diabetes, the body may not use insulin effectively, leading to insulin resistance. this can result in the pancreas producing more insulin to compensate, but over time, it may not be enough to regulate blood sugar levels, leading to elevated glucose in the bloodstream. maintaining proper insulin function is essential for overall health, and disruptions in insulin production or utilization can lead to conditions like diabetes. management of diabetes often involves strategies to regulate insulin levels, either through lifestyle modifications, medications, or insulin therapy. insulin resistance: in type 2 diabetes, the body's cells become resistant to the action of insulin. insulin is needed to allow sugar (glucose) to enter cells for energy. when cells resist insulin's signal, glucose builds up in the bloodstream, leading to high blood sugar levels. causes and risk factors: genetics: family history of diabetes can increase the risk. certain ethnic groups (e.g., african american, hispanic, native american) are more prone. weight: being overweight or obese is a significant risk factor. physical inactivity: lack of exercise can contribute to insulin resistance. unhealthy diet: high consumption of processed foods, sugary beverages, and a lack of fiber. medical conditions: metabolic syndrome: a cluster of conditions (abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low hdl cholesterol) increases diabetes risk. polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos): common in women and associated with insulin resistance. age and gender: risk increases with age, especially after 45. women with a history of gestational diabetes are at higher risk. symptoms: early symptoms: increased thirst (polydipsia) and hunger: experiencing excessive thirst and hunger. frequent urination: needing to urinate often, especially at night. fatigue: feeling tired and lethargic. tingling or numbness in your hands or feet dry skin. unexplained weight loss. advanced symptoms: blurred vision. slow wound healing. recurrent infections. people assigned female at birth (afab) may experience frequent vaginal yeast infections and/or urinary tract infections (utis). if you have these symptoms, it's important to see your healthcare provider. simple blood tests can diagnose t2d. diagnosis: blood tests: fasting blood sugar, oral glucose tolerance test, and a1c test. symptoms and clinical signs: your doctor may consider your symptoms and overall health. management: lifestyle changes: healthy diet, regular exercise, weight management. medications: oral medications or insulin therapy may be prescribed. monitoring: regular blood sugar monitoring is important. complications: untreated or poorly managed type 2 diabetes can lead to serious complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, nerve damage, and vision problems. cardiovascular complications: increased risk of heart disease and stroke. hypertension often accompanies diabetes. microvascular complications: nephropathy (kidney disease). neuropathy (nerve damage). retinopathy (vision problems). foot complications: peripheral neuropathy increases the risk of foot ulcers and amputations. management: lifestyle modifications: healthy diet emphasizing whole foods, fruits, vegetables, and fiber. regular physical activity. weight management. medications: oral medications (e.g., metformin) to improve insulin sensitivity. insulin therapy if oral medications are insufficient. blood sugar monitoring: regular monitoring to track blood glucose levels. education and support: diabetes education on self-care and management. emotional support for coping with the psychological aspects of diabetes. prevention: healthy lifestyle: adopting a healthy diet and regular exercise. maintaining a healthy weight. regular check-ups: regular health check-ups to monitor blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and cholesterol. public health implications: global impact: rising prevalence worldwide, associated with urbanization and lifestyle changes. healthcare costs: substantial economic burden due to healthcare costs and productivity loss. what is obesity? obesity is a medical condition characterized by the accumulation of excessive body fat to the extent that it may have a negative impact on health. it is often defined by body mass index (bmi), which is a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of their height in meters. a bmi of 30 or higher is generally considered indicative of obesity. 1. bmi categories: underweight: bmi less than 18.5 normal weight: bmi 18.5 to 24.9 overweight: bmi 25 to 29.9 obesity: bmi 30 or higher 2. causes: caloric imbalance: obesity typically results from consuming more calories than the body uses, leading to the storage of excess energy as fat. genetics: genetic factors can influence an individual's predisposition to obesity. environmental factors: factors such as unhealthy diets, sedentary lifestyles, and lack of access to nutritious foods can contribute. 3. health risks: obesity is associated with an increased risk of various health conditions, including: type 2 diabetes cardiovascular diseases (heart disease and stroke) certain types of cancer sleep apnea osteoarthritis respiratory problems mental health issues 4. prevention and management: adopting a healthy, balanced diet with appropriate portion sizes. engaging in regular physical activity. behavioral interventions and counseling. medical treatments and, in some cases, bariatric surgery for severe obesity. 5. global prevalence: obesity has become a global health concern, affecting people of all ages and socioeconomic backgrounds. the prevalence of obesity has risen significantly in recent decades. 6. stigma and discrimination: individuals with obesity may face societal stigma and discrimination, affecting their mental and emotional well-being. 7. childhood obesity: childhood obesity is a particular concern, as it can lead to health issues later in life. addressing obesity often requires a multifaceted approach, involving changes in diet, increased physical activity, behavioral modifications, and sometimes medical interventions. it's essential to recognize obesity as a complex health issue with various contributing factors and to approach its prevention and management with a comprehensive and individualized strategy. what is high triglycerides? triglycerides are a type of fat (lipid) found in your blood. when you eat, your body converts any calories it doesn't need to use right away into triglycerides. these triglycerides are stored in fat cells for later use. while your body needs triglycerides for energy, having too high a level of triglycerides in your blood can be a risk factor for various health issues. normal triglyceride levels: normal: less than 150 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) borderline high: 150 to 199 mg/dl high: 200 to 499 mg/dl very high: 500 mg/dl or higher causes of high triglycerides: 1. unhealthy diet: diets high in saturated fats, trans fats, and refined carbohydrates can contribute to elevated triglyceride levels. 2. lack of physical activity: sedentary lifestyles and lack of regular exercise can lead to higher triglyceride levels. 3. obesity: being overweight or obese is often associated with higher triglyceride levels. 4. insulin resistance and diabetes: insulin resistance and diabetes can lead to increased triglycerides. 5. genetics: some people may have a genetic predisposition to higher triglyceride levels. 6. certain medical conditions: hypothyroidism, kidney disease, and liver disease can contribute to elevated triglycerides. 7. alcohol consumption: excessive alcohol intake can raise triglyceride levels. health risks associated with high triglycerides: 1. cardiovascular disease: high triglycerides, especially when combined with low levels of hdl cholesterol, can contribute to atherosclerosis (hardening and narrowing of the arteries) and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. 2. pancreatitis: extremely high levels of triglycerides can lead to inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), a serious and potentially life-threatening condition. management of high triglycerides: 1. lifestyle changes: adopting a heart-healthy diet low in saturated and trans fats, and high in omega-3 fatty acids. regular physical activity. limiting alcohol intake. 2. medications: statins and other medications may be prescribed to lower triglyceride levels. 3. treatment of underlying conditions: managing underlying conditions such as diabetes or hypothyroidism. 4. regular monitoring: regular blood tests to monitor triglyceride levels. it's important to note that managing triglyceride levels is often part of an overall strategy to maintain heart health. lifestyle modifications, including a healthy diet and regular exercise, are key components of preventing and managing high triglycerides. individuals with concerns about their triglyceride levels should consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and appropriate interventions. what is low hdl cholesterol? hdl cholesterol, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, is often referred to as "good" cholesterol. it plays a crucial role in the body by helping to remove other forms of cholesterol, specifically low-density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol (often called "bad" cholesterol), from the bloodstream. hdl cholesterol carries cholesterol away from the arteries and back to the liver, where it can be processed and eliminated. this process helps prevent the buildup of plaque in the arteries. normal hdl cholesterol levels: desirable: 60 mg/dl and above borderline: 40 to 59 mg/dl poor: less than 40 mg/dl causes of low hdl cholesterol: 1. unhealthy lifestyle: lack of physical activity and a sedentary lifestyle can contribute to low hdl cholesterol levels. 2.unhealthy diet: diets high in saturated and trans fats can lower hdl cholesterol. 3. smoking: smoking is associated with lower hdl cholesterol levels. 4.genetics: genetic factors can influence cholesterol levels, including hdl cholesterol. 5. obesity: being overweight or obese can be associated with lower hdl cholesterol. 6.certain medical conditions: type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and some rare genetic disorders can affect hdl cholesterol levels. health implications of low hdl cholesterol: 1. increased cardiovascular risk: low hdl cholesterol is considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. hdl cholesterol helps remove cholesterol from the arteries, and low levels may contribute to the buildup of plaque, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke. 2. combination with high ldl cholesterol: having both low hdl cholesterol and high ldl cholesterol can significantly elevate cardiovascular risk. management of low hdl cholesterol: 1. lifestyle changes: regular physical activity, including aerobic exercise, can help raise hdl cholesterol. adopting a heart-healthy diet that includes sources of healthy fats, such as omega-3 fatty acids. 2. quit smoking: quitting smoking can have positive effects on hdl cholesterol levels. 3. weight management: losing weight, if necessary, can improve hdl cholesterol levels. 4. medications: in some cases, medications may be prescribed to raise hdl cholesterol, although lifestyle changes are usually the first approach. it's important to note that cholesterol levels are just one aspect of cardiovascular health, and overall heart health involves a combination of factors, including blood pressure, blood sugar, and lifestyle habits. individuals concerned about their cholesterol levels should consult with a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation and personalized advice on managing their cardiovascular risk. what is hyperglycemia (high blood sugar)? hyperglycemia happens when there’s too much sugar (glucose) in your blood. it's also called high blood sugar or high blood glucose. this happens when your body has too little insulin (a hormone) or if your body can't use insulin properly (insulin resistance). hyperglycemia usually means you have diabetes, and people with diabetes can experience hyperglycemia episodes frequently. if you have hyperglycemia that's untreated for long periods of time, it can damage your nerves, blood vessels, tissues and organs. severe hyperglycemia can also lead to an acute (sudden and severe) life-threatening complication called diabetes-related ketoacidosis (dka), especially in people with diabetes who take insulin or people with undiagnosed type 1 diabetes. this requires immediate medical treatment. what is blood sugar? glucose (sugar) mainly comes from carbohydrates in the food and drinks you consume. it's your body's main source of energy. your blood carries glucose to all of your body's cells to use for energy. if you don't have diabetes, several bodily processes naturally help keep your blood glucose in a healthy range. insulin, a hormone your pancreas makes, is the most significant contributor to maintaining healthy blood sugar. high blood sugar most often happens due to a lack of insulin or insulin resistance. this leads to diabetes. people who have diabetes must use medication, like oral diabetes medications or synthetic insulin, and/or lifestyle changes to help keep their blood sugar levels in range. current diabetes statistics in the philippines according to the international diabetes federation or idf, the prevalence rate of diabetes in filipino adults is approximately 6.3%. that means that out of 63 million adults in our country, almost 4 million have diabetes. but, even with these high figures, there could be more undocumented diabetes cases in the philippines. after all, the idf didn’t include younger people in their data, and they didn’t take pre-diabetes into consideration. what’s even more alarming is that in a 2016 report, the world health organization announced that 6% of all deaths in the philippines occurred due to diabetes. is type 2 diabetes genetic? the cause of t2d is complex, but researchers know that genetics play a strong role. your lifetime risk of developing t2d is 40% if you have one biological parent with t2d and 70% if both of your biological parents have it. researchers have identified at least 150 dna variations linked to the risk of developing t2d some increase your risk and others decrease it. some of these variations may directly play a role in insulin resistance and insulin production. others may increase your risk of t2d by increasing your tendency to have overweight or obesity. these genetic variations likely act together with health and lifestyle factors to influence your overall risk of t2d. what are the risk factors for type 2 diabetes? you’re more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you: have a family history of type 2 diabetes (biological parent or sibling). are older than 45. have overweight or obesity (a bmi greater than 25). are physically active less than three times a week. are black, hispanic, native american, asian american or pacific islander. had gestational diabetes while pregnant. have high blood pressure or high cholesterol. have prediabetes. have polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos). as t2d symptoms typically come on slowly, it’s important to see your primary care provider regularly if you're at risk for the condition. this way, they can do screenings, like a basic metabolic panel (bmp), to check on your blood sugar levels. it’s better to catch t2d earlier rather than later. diagnosis and tests how is type 2 diabetes diagnosed? the following blood tests help your healthcare provider diagnose type 2 diabetes: fasting plasma glucose test: this lab test checks your blood sugar level. you typically need to get this test in the morning after an eight-hour fast (nothing to eat or drink except water). a result of 126 mg/dl or higher means you have diabetes. random plasma glucose test: this lab test also checks your blood sugar, but you can get it at any time without fasting. a result of 200 mg/dl or higher means you have diabetes. a1c test: this lab test measures your average blood sugar levels over the past two to three months. a result of 6.5% or higher means you have diabetes. in some cases, your provider may order an auto antibody blood test to see if you have type 1 diabetes instead of t2d. management and treatment what is the treatment for type 2 diabetes? unlike many health conditions, you mainly manage t2d on your own with medical guidance and support from your healthcare team. this could include your: primary care physician (pcp) or endocrinologist. registered dietitian. certified diabetes care and education specialist (cdces). ophthalmologist (eye doctor). dentist. your team should also include family members and other important people in your life. managing t2d can be challenging you have to make several decisions every day for it. but everything you do to improve your health is worth it. the core features of type 2 diabetes management include: lifestyle changes, like more exercise and eating adjustments. blood sugar monitoring. medication. exercise for type 2 diabetes regular activity is important for everyone. it's even more important if you have diabetes. exercise is good for your health because it: lowers your blood sugar level without medication in the short term and long term. burns calories and may help with weight loss. improves blood flow and blood pressure. increases your energy level and boosts your mood. helps with stress management. talk to your provider before starting any exercise program. you may need to take special steps before, during and after physical activity, especially if you take insulin. the general goal is to get at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity. type 2 diabetes diet ask your healthcare provider or registered dietitian to recommend a meal plan that’s right for you. what you eat, how much you eat, and when you eat are all important in keeping your blood sugar levels in the range that your healthcare team recommends. the key to eating with type 2 diabetes is to eat a variety of nutritious foods from all food groups, in the amounts your meal plan outlines. in general, these types of foods can help support healthy blood sugar levels: lean proteins, like chicken, eggs, fish and turkey. non-starchy vegetables, like broccoli, green beans, salad greens and cucumbers. healthy fats, like avocados, nuts, natural peanut butter and olive oil. complex carbohydrates, like beans, berries, sweet potatoes and whole-wheat bread. blood sugar monitoring: monitoring your blood sugar is essential to finding out how well your current treatment plan is working. it gives you information on how to manage diabetes on a daily and sometimes even hourly basis. the results of blood sugar monitoring can help you make decisions about food, physical activity and dosing insulin. several things can affect your blood sugar. you can learn to predict some of these impacts with time and practice, while others are very difficult or impossible to predict. that’s why it’s important to check your blood sugar regularly if your healthcare provider recommends doing so. there are two main ways you can monitor your blood sugar at home if you have diabetes: with a glucose meter and finger stick. with a continuous glucose monitor (cgm). you may choose either or both methods for a variety of reasons, such as: your access to the technology, which can vary due to cost and medical insurance coverage. how often your healthcare provider recommends checking your blood sugar. the medications you’re taking. your overall health. your healthcare provider may recommend taking medication, in addition to lifestyle changes, to manage type 2 diabetes. these include: oral diabetes medications: these are medications that you take by mouth to help manage blood sugar levels in people who have t2d but still produce some insulin. there are several types. the most commonly prescribed one is metformin. your provider may prescribe more than one oral diabetes medication at a time to achieve the best blood glucose management. glp-1 and dual glp-1/gipagonists: these are injectable medications that mainly help manage blood sugar levels in people with t2d. some glp-1 agonists can also help treat obesity. insulin: synthetic insulin directly lowers blood sugar levels. there are several types of insulin, like long-acting and short-acting types. you may inject it with syringes or pens, use inhaled insulin, or use an insulin pump. other medications: you may take other medications to manage coexisting conditions, like high blood pressure and high cholesterol. can type 2 diabetes be reversed? type 2 diabetes is a chronic (long-term) disease, which means you must manage it for the rest of your life. there’s no cure for t2d. but you can manage it with lifestyle changes, medication and blood sugar monitoring in a way that keeps your blood sugar levels in a healthy range. if you stop managing it or undermanage it, your blood sugar levels will go back up. prevention can prevent type 2 diabetes? certain strategies can help lower your risk of developing type 2 diabetes or delay its onset, including: exercising regularly (at least 150 minutes a week). maintaining a weight that's healthy for you. eating nutritious food. not smoking. unfortunately, some people have such strong genetic risk factors that even lifestyle changes aren't enough to prevent developing t2d. what is the outlook for type 2 diabetes? if you have type 2 diabetes, your outlook depends on several factors, like: your age at diagnosis. how often and how well you’re able to keep your blood sugar levels in range. if you have other conditions, like high blood pressure or high cholesterol. your access to healthcare, diabetes management tools and medication, nutritious foods and support from loved ones. untreated or undermanaged t2d can lead to a range of health conditions. what are the complications of type 2 diabetes? as your blood touches virtually every part of your body, having undermanaged type 2 diabetes that results in continuous high blood sugar over a long period of time can damage several areas of your body. potential complications of type 2 diabetes include: cardiovascular disease, including: coronary artery disease (cad). peripheral artery disease (pad). cerebrovascular disease. heart attack. stroke. eye conditions, including: diabetes-related retinopathy. diabetes-related macular edema. cataracts. glaucoma. blindness. additional complications include: diabetes-related nephropathy (kidney disease). diabetes-related neuropathy (nerve damage). skin conditions, like dry skin and bacterial and fungal infections. foot problems, including ulcers and infections that can lead to gangrene and possible amputation. gum disease and other oral health problems. hearing loss. digestive problems, including gastroparesis. sexual dysfunction. short-term complications of t2d hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (hhs) is a life-threatening complication of type 2 diabetes. hhs happens when your blood sugar levels are too high for a long period, leading to severe dehydration and confusion. symptoms of hhs usually come on slowly and can take days or weeks to develop. symptoms include: very high blood sugar level (over 600 mg/d l). mental changes, such as confusion, delirium or experiencing hallucinations. loss of consciousness. dry mouth and extreme thirst. frequent urination. blurred vision or loss of vision. weakness or paralysis that may be worse on one side of your body. hhs is life-threatening and requires immediate medical treatment. if you experience these symptoms, call 911 or your local emergency services number. living with how do i take care of myself if i have type 2 diabetes? type 2 diabetes is a complex condition that requires daily management, effort and planning. some tips that can help you manage t2d include: try to stick to healthy lifestyle changes: regular exercise and healthy eating plans are core parts of t2d management. set small goals and make one change at a time to prevent becoming overwhelmed. check your blood sugar regularly checking your blood sugar with a fingerstick and meter or using a continuous glucose monitor (cgm) is crucial to managing diabetes and preventing complications. follow your providers guidance for how often you should be checking it. take your medication regularly: follow your healthcare providers instructions for taking your medications (if applicable). see your diabetes provider regularly: it's important to see the provider who helps you manage t2d regularly to be sure that your management plan is working. don’t be afraid to ask them specific questions. see your other providers regularly, especially your eye doctor: type 2 diabetes can cause complications in various areas of your body, but especially your eyes. it’s important to see your eye doctor (ophthalmologist) at least yearly so that they can check the health of your eyes. have a sick day plan: talk with your diabetes provider about how to take care of yourself and manage t2d when you’re sick. illness can make it more difficult to manage blood sugar levels and can trigger hhs. stay educated: don’t be afraid to ask your provider questions about t2d. the more you know about t2d and your management, the more likely you'll be able to live healthily and prevent complications. find community: connecting with other people who have t2d whether in-person or online can help you feel less alone. take care of your mental health: people with diabetes are two to three times more likely to have depression and are 20% more likely to be diagnosed with anxiety than those without diabetes. living with a chronic condition that requires constant care can be overwhelming. it's important to talk to a mental health professional if you're experiencing signs of depression or anxiety. when should i see my healthcare provider if i have type 2 diabetes? you’ll need to have regular appointments with your healthcare team to be sure you're on track with your t2d management plan. as your body, life and routines change, your management will need to, as well. your healthcare team can provide new strategies that are unique to your needs. if you develop symptoms of any diabetes complications, be sure to see your provider as soon as possible. a note from cleveland clinic type 2 diabetes involves constant day-to-day care and management. while it'll likely be very overwhelming at first, over time you'll get a better grasp on how to manage the condition and how to be in tune with your body.be sure to see your healthcare team regularly. managing type 2 diabetes involves a team effort you’ll want both medical professionals and friends and family on your side. don’t hesitate to reach out to them if you need help. type 2 diabetes is a condition that happens because of a problem in the way the body regulates and uses sugar as a fuel. that sugar also is called glucose. this long-term condition results in too much sugar circulating in the blood. eventually, high blood sugar levels can lead to disorders of the circulatory, nervous and immune systems. in type 2 diabetes, there are primarily two problems. the pancreas does not produce enough insulin a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into the cells. and cells respond poorly to insulin and take in less sugar. type 2 diabetes used to be known as adult-onset diabetes, but both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can begin during childhood and adulthood. type 2 is more common in older adults. but the increase in the number of children with obesity has led to more cases of type 2 diabetes in younger people. there's no cure for type 2 diabetes. losing weight, eating well and exercising can help manage the disease. if diet and exercise aren't enough to control blood sugar, diabetes medications or insulin therapy may be recommended. symptoms symptoms of type 2 diabetes often develop slowly. in fact, you can be living with type 2 diabetes for years and not know it. when symptoms are present, they may include: increased thirst: experiencing a persistent feeling of thirst, often accompanied by a need to drink larger amounts of water than usual. frequent urination: having to urinate more often than usual, which may include waking up frequently during the night to urinate. increased hunger: feeling hungry more frequently or having an increased appetite, sometimes even after eating. unintended weight loss: losing weight without actively trying to do so, which may be a result of the body not properly utilizing glucose for energy. fatigue: persistent feelings of tiredness and lack of energy, even with adequate rest. - blurred vision: experiencing blurry or distorted vision, which can be a result of changes in the fluid levels within the eyes due to high blood sugar. slow-healing sores: wounds and sores taking longer to heal than usual, which is linked to reduced circulation and compromised immune function. slow healing of wounds: similar to slow-healing sores, individuals with diabetes may experience delays in the healing of cuts, bruises, or other injuries. frequent infections: increased susceptibility to infections, such as urinary tract infections, skin infections, and others, due to compromised immune function. numbness or tingling in the hands or feet: peripheral neuropathy, a condition where nerve damage can lead to sensations of numbness, tingling, or pain in the extremities. - areas of darkened skin, usually in the armpits and neck: acanthosis nigricans, a condition characterized by dark, thickened, and velvety skin in certain areas, often associated with insulin resistance. risk factors - insulin resistance: the primary factor in type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance. the body's cells become resistant to the effects of insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar. as a result, the pancreas produces more insulin to compensate, but over time, it may not keep up with the increased demand. - genetics: there is a genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes, and having a family history of the condition increases the risk. lifestyle factors: 1. obesity: excess body weight, especially around the abdomen, is a significant risk factor for type 2 diabetes. 2. physical inactivity: lack of regular physical activity is associated with an increased risk. 3. unhealthy diet: diets high in refined sugars, saturated fats, and processed foods can contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes. age and ethnicity: the risk of type 2 diabetes increases with age, and certain ethnic groups, such as african americans, hispanics, native americans, and asian americans, are more prone to the condition. obesity: obesity is a medical condition characterized by an excessive accumulation of body fat. it is often measured using the body mass index (bmi), with obesity defined as a bmi of 30 or higher. obesity is a significant risk factor for type 2 diabetes, as excess body fat can lead to insulin resistance. sedentary lifestyle: a sedentary lifestyle refers to a pattern of living that involves little or no physical activity or exercise. lack of regular physical activity is associated with various health risks, including an increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. sedentary behavior may involve extended periods of sitting or low levels of physical movement. family history: family history refers to the presence of a particular health condition, such as diabetes, among close biological relatives (parents, siblings). having a family history of diabetes can increase an individual's risk of developing the condition, suggesting a genetic predisposition. age: age is a non-modifiable risk factor for type 2 diabetes. the risk of developing diabetes increases with age, particularly after the age of 45. this may be attributed to factors such as changes in metabolism, hormonal changes, and cumulative exposure to other risk factors over time. ethnicity: ethnicity refers to the cultural and ancestral background of an individual. certain ethnic groups have a higher predisposition to type 2 diabetes. for example, african americans, hispanics, native americans, asian americans, and pacific islanders are at an increased risk compared to the general population. genetic factors and lifestyle patterns within specific ethnic communities contribute to these disparities. causes - genes: scientists have found different bits of dna that affect how your body makes insulin. weight: having extra weight or obesity can cause insulin resistance. metabolic syndrome. people with insulin resistance often have a group of conditions including high blood sugar, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol and triglycerides. too much glucose from your liver: when your blood sugar is low, your liver makes and sends out glucose. after you eat, your blood sugar goes up, and your liver usually slows down and stores its glucose for later. but some people's livers don't. they keep making sugar. bad communication between cells: sometimes, cells send the wrong signals or don't pick up messages correctly. when these problems affect how your cells make and use insulin or glucose, this can lead to diabetes. broken beta cells: if the cells that make insulin send it out at the wrong time, your blood sugar gets thrown off. high blood sugar can damage these cells, too. medical history and health: insulin resistance: insulin resistance is a condition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar. it can lead to elevated blood glucose levels and is a precursor to type 2 diabetes. prediabetes: prediabetes is a condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. individuals with prediabetes have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. heart and blood vessel disease: heart and blood vessel diseases encompass a range of conditions affecting the cardiovascular system, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, and stroke. diabetes is a significant risk factor for these diseases. high blood pressure: high blood pressure (hypertension) is a condition where the force of blood against the artery walls is consistently too high. it is a common risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and individuals with diabetes are at an increased risk. low hdl ("good") cholesterol: hdl cholesterol is often referred to as "good" cholesterol as it helps remove other forms of cholesterol from the bloodstream. low levels of hdl cholesterol are associated with an increased risk of heart disease. high triglycerides: triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood. high levels of triglycerides are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and they often accompany conditions like obesity and insulin resistance. being overweight or having obesity: being overweight or having obesity is a condition where excess body fat accumulates, increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other health problems. - having a baby who weighed more than 9 pounds: giving birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds may be a risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes later in life. gestational diabetes: gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. women who have had gestational diabetes are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos): pcos is a hormonal disorder common among women of reproductive age. it is associated with insulin resistance and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. depression: depression is a mental health condition characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, and other emotional and physical symptoms. it may be linked to an increased risk of developing diabetes. lifestyle factors: getting little or no exercise: lack of physical activity and a sedentary lifestyle are significant risk factors for type 2 diabetes. regular exercise helps improve insulin sensitivity and manage weight. smoking: smoking is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including heart disease. individuals who smoke and have diabetes face an increased risk of complications. stress: chronic stress can contribute to unhealthy lifestyle habits, such as overeating or not getting enough exercise, which may increase the risk of developing diabetes. sleeping too little or too much: disruptions in sleep patterns, whether due to insufficient sleep or excessive sleep, can affect metabolism and insulin sensitivity, potentially contributing to diabetes risk. type 2 diabetes diagnosis and tests diagnosing type 2 diabetes typically involves a combination of clinical evaluation and laboratory tests. here are the common methods and tests used for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes: 1. symptoms and clinical evaluation: symptoms: the presence of classic symptoms such as increased thirst, frequent urination, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and others may prompt further investigation. medical history: the healthcare provider will review the patient's medical history, including family history of diabetes and other relevant factors. 2. fasting blood sugar test: this test measures the blood glucose level after an overnight fast (usually at least 8 hours without eating or drinking anything except water). diagnostic criteria: a fasting blood sugar level of 126 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) or higher on two separate occasions generally indicates diabetes. 3. oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt): the ogtt involves fasting overnight and then drinking a sugary solution. blood sugar levels are measured at intervals after consuming the solution. diagnostic criteria: a blood sugar level of 200 mg/dl or higher two hours after drinking the solution is indicative of diabetes. 4. hemoglobin a1c test: this test measures the average blood glucose level over the past two to three months by assessing the percentage of hemoglobin that is glycated (bound to glucose). diagnostic criteria: an a1c level of 6.5% or higher is generally used for the diagnosis of diabetes. 5. random blood sugar test: this test measures blood glucose levels at any time of the day, regardless of when the individual last ate. diagnostic criteria: a random blood sugar level of 200 mg/dl or higher, along with diabetes symptoms, may indicate diabetes. 6. clinical guidelines and criteria: - world health organization (who): the who also offers criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes, including fasting glucose levels and oral glucose tolerance tests. 7. blood tests: a1c (glycated hemoglobin) test: purpose: measures the average percentage of hemoglobin that is glycated (bound to glucose) over the past 2 or 3 months. procedure: a blood sample is taken, and the result is expressed as a percentage. an a1c level of 6.5% or higher is generally used for the diagnosis of diabetes. fasting plasma glucose test: purpose: measures blood sugar levels after an overnight fast. procedure: the individual refrains from eating or drinking (except water) for at least 8 hours before the test. a blood sample is taken, and a fasting glucose level of 126 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) or higher on two separate occasions may indicate diabetes. oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt): purpose: checks blood glucose levels before and 2 hours after consuming a sweetened beverage to evaluate how the body handles sugar. procedure: the individual drinks a sugary solution, and blood samples are taken before and after. a blood sugar level of 200 mg/dl or higher 2 hours after drinking the solution is indicative of diabetes. it's important to note that the diagnostic criteria and methods may vary slightly between different organizations and regions. additionally, the diagnosis is not solely based on a single test result; healthcare providers consider multiple factors, including the patient's overall health, risk factors, and symptoms. individuals at risk for type 2 diabetes, such as those with a family history or certain lifestyle factors, may undergo regular screenings to detect the condition early. early detection and management are crucial for preventing complications associated with diabetes. a healthcare professional will determine the most appropriate diagnostic approach based on the individual's circumstances. stages of type 2 diabetes 1. insulin resistance: description: in this initial stage, the body usually produces enough insulin to regulate blood sugar levels within the normal range. however, cells resist the effects of insulin, meaning they don't use it efficiently. as a result, the body compensates by producing more insulin to aid glucose entry into the cells. characteristics: insulin resistance may be temporary, but it can persist over time. there isn't a specific test to directly measure insulin resistance, making it challenging to diagnose this stage directly. 2. prediabetes: description: insulin resistance, if not addressed, leads to an accumulation of glucose in the blood. prediabetes is the stage where blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not elevated enough to be classified as diabetes. during this stage, individuals may not experience noticeable symptoms. diagnostic criteria: an a1c (glycated hemoglobin) level between 5.7% and 6.4% is indicative of prediabetes. this blood test provides an average of blood glucose levels over the past 2-3 months. implications of prediabetes: individuals with prediabetes are at an increased risk for developing heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. early intervention through lifestyle modifications, such as a healthy diet and regular physical activity, can help prevent the progression to type 2 diabetes. it's important to note that these stages represent a continuum, and the progression to type 2 diabetes is not inevitable. lifestyle changes, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and weight management, can play a crucial role in preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes in individuals with insulin resistance or prediabetes. regular health check-ups and screenings are important for early detection and intervention. type 2 diabetes treatment the treatment of type 2 diabetes involves a comprehensive approach that includes lifestyle changes and, in some cases, medication. here are the key components of type 2 diabetes treatment: 1. lifestyle changes: weight loss: objective: achieving and maintaining a healthy weight. benefits: weight loss can improve insulin sensitivity and help regulate blood sugar levels. recommendation: losing at least 7% of body weight is considered beneficial. healthy eating: objective: adopting a balanced and nutritious diet. guidance: work with a registered dietitian to learn about carbohydrates, create a meal plan, and focus on: eating fewer calories. reducing consumption of refined carbs, especially sweets. incorporating more vegetables and fruits into the diet. increasing fiber intake. regular exercise: objective: engaging in regular physical activity. recommendation: aim for 30 to 60 minutes of exercise every day, which can include activities such as walking, biking, swimming, or other forms of aerobic exercise. strength training, like yoga or weightlifting, is also beneficial. note: check with your healthcare provider before starting a new exercise program, especially if you have other health concerns. monitoring blood sugar levels: objective: regularly checking blood sugar levels to track the effectiveness of treatment. guidance: depending on your treatment plan, especially if you are on insulin, your doctor will provide instructions on how often to monitor blood sugar levels. medication: purpose: medications may be prescribed to help manage blood sugar levels. types of medications: oral medications: these include various classes of drugs that help improve insulin sensitivity, reduce glucose production by the liver, and enhance glucose uptake by cells. injectable medications: some people may require insulin injections or other injectable medications to control blood sugar. regular medical check-ups: importance: regular visits to your healthcare provider are crucial to monitor overall health, adjust treatment plans as needed, and address any emerging issues. diabetes education: purpose: empower individuals with the knowledge and skills to manage their diabetes effectively. resources: diabetes education programs and support from healthcare professionals, including registered dietitians and diabetes educators. medication if lifestyle changes don’t get you to your target blood sugar levels, you may need medication. some of the most common for type 2 diabetes include: 1. metformin (fortamet, glucophage, glumetza, riomet). this is usually the first medication used to treat type 2 diabetes. it lowers the amount of glucose your liver makes and helps your body respond better to the insulin it does make. 2. sulfonylureas. this group of drugs helps your body make more insulin. they include glimepiride (amaryl), glipizide (glucotrol), and glyburide (dia beta, micronase). 3. meglitinides. they help your body make more insulin, and they work faster than sulfonylureas. you might take nateglinide (starlix) or repaglinide (prandin). 4. thiazolidinediones. like metformin, they make you more sensitive to insulin. you could get pioglitazone (actos) or rosiglitazone (avandia). but they also raise your risk of heart problems, so they aren't usually a first choice for treatment. 5. dpp-4 inhibitors. these medications -- linagliptin (tradjenta), saxagliptin (onglyza), and sitagliptin (januvia) help lower your blood sugar levels, but they can also cause joint pain and could inflame your pancreas. they work by blocking dpp-4, which is an enzyme that affects the hormone incretin. 6. glp-1 receptor agonists. you take these medications with a needle to slow digestion and lower blood sugar levels. some of the most common ones are exenatide (byetta, bydureon), liraglutide (victoza), and semaglutide (ozempic). 7. sglt2 inhibitors. these help your kidneys filter out more glucose. you might get bexagliflozin (brenzavvy), canagliflozin (invokana), dapagliflozin (farxiga), or empagliflozin (jardiance). empagliflozin has also proven effective in reducing the risk of hospitalization or death from heart failure. 8. gipand glp-1 receptor agonist. tirzepatide (mounjaro) is the first in its class and activates both the glp-1 and gipreceptors, which leads to improved blood sugar control. 9. insulin. you might take long-lasting shots at night, such as insulin detemir (levemir) or insulin glargine (lantus). complications 1. cardiovascular diseases: description: high blood sugar levels over time can lead to damage in the heart and blood vessels, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. specific risks: increased likelihood of heart disease or stroke. higher risk of blocked blood vessels (atherosclerosis). elevated risk of chest pain (angina). 2. nerve damage (neuropathy): description: prolonged exposure to high blood sugar can cause damage to the nerves throughout the body. specific risks: digestive issues. impaired feeling in the feet. sexual response problems. 3. kidney disease: description: diabetes is a leading cause of kidney disease and can lead to kidney failure. specific risks: kidney damage requiring dialysis or transplantation. 4. eye problems (retinopathy): description: high blood sugar can damage the tiny blood vessels in the eyes, leading to vision problems. specific risks: retinopathy, which can cause blindness if untreated. 5. foot problems and amputation risk: description: poor circulation and nerve damage can contribute to foot problems, increasing the risk of infections and, in severe cases, amputation. specific risks: slower wound healing. increased risk of infections. 6. other complications: pregnancy: increased risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, or birth defects in infants born to parents with diabetes. sleep apnea: individuals with diabetes may be more prone to developing sleep apnea, a condition characterized by interrupted breathing during sleep. hearing problems: higher likelihood of hearing problems, though the exact relationship is not clear. brain health: high blood sugar levels may contribute to brain damage and an increased risk of conditions such as alzheimer's disease. depression: people with diabetes are twice as likely to experience depression compared to those without the condition. type 2 diabetes diet guidelines: 1. work with a dietitian: collaborate with a registered dietitian to create a personalized meal plan based on your specific needs, preferences, and health goals. 2. focus on whole foods:

possible. control carbohydrates: 3. reduce added sugars: minimize the intake of foods and beverages with added sugars, such as sugary drinks, candies, and desserts. choose complex carbohydrates: opt for whole grains, legumes, and high-fiber foods to help regulate blood sugar levels. replace low-fiber refined grains (e.g., white bread) with whole grains (e.g., whole wheat bread, brown rice). 4. prioritize non-starchy vegetables: include in every meal: boost your intake of non-starchy vegetables like broccoli, leafy greens, peppers, and green beans. these vegetables are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. 5. moderate portion sizes: portion control: be mindful of portion sizes to manage calorie intake and prevent overeating. use smaller plates to help control portions. 6. lean protein sources: choose lean proteins: include lean protein sources such as poultry, fish, tofu, legumes, and low-fat dairy in your diet. limit red and processed meats. 7. healthy fats: opt for healthy fats: choose sources of healthy fats, such as avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil. limit saturated and trans fats found in fried foods and processed snacks. 8. regular meal timing: establish consistent meal times: aim for regular meal timings to help regulate blood sugar levels. include snacks if needed, especially if taking medications that may cause low blood sugar. 9. stay hydrated: drink water: stay hydrated by drinking water throughout the day. limit sugary beverages and alcohol. 10. monitor blood sugar responses: test and analyze: regularly monitor blood sugar levels to understand how different foods impact your readings. adjust your diet based on your blood sugar responses. 11. individualized approach: personalize your plan: recognize that individual responses to foods can vary. tailor your diet to your specific needs and preferences. 12. regular review and adjustments: stay in touch with healthcare providers: regularly review your diet plan with healthcare providers and make adjustments as needed. managing type 2 diabetes managing your type 2 diabetes well helps you avoid complications and feel your best. along with a healthy diet, regular exercise, and medication as prescribed: 1. keep your blood pressure and cholesterol levels in the healthy range. high levels of either could raise your risk of diabetes complications. 2. get regular eye exams, dentist visits, and physicals. 3. check your feet daily for sores, redness, or swelling and let your doctor know if you notice any issues. 4. get at least 7 hours of good-quality sleep each night, as sleep loss interferes with blood sugar control. ask your doctor for help if you have a hard time sleeping. 5. be careful with alcohol. limit alcoholic drinks to 1-2 drinks a day, depending on your size and gender. if you do drink alcohol, check your blood sugar afterward. 6. work with your doctor to come up with a sick day plan. even a minor illness can interfere with your blood sugar and insulin levels. you may need to adjust your medications or check your blood sugar more often. type 2 diabetes prevention strategies: 1. weight management: - aim to lose 7% to 10% of your body weight if overweight. - weight loss in this range can significantly reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. 2. regular physical activity: engage in at least 30 minutes of brisk walking or moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. physical activity helps improve insulin sensitivity and overall metabolic health. 3. healthy eating habits: avoid highly processed carbohydrates. limit the consumption of sugary drinks. reduce intake of trans and saturated fats. limit red and processed meat consumption. emphasize a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. 4. smoking cessation: quit smoking to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. work with your doctor to manage weight gain that may occur after quitting. 5. regular monitoring of health: keep track of key health indicators, including blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and body weight. regular health check-ups and screenings can help detect and address risk factors early. 6. healthy diet: adopt a well-balanced and nutritious diet that supports overall health. work with a dietitian if needed to create a personalized meal plan. 7. regular exercise routine: establish and maintain a regular exercise routine that includes both aerobic and strength-training exercises. exercise is a powerful tool in preventing and managing diabetes. 8. weight management: strive to maintain a healthy weight through a combination of a balanced diet and regular physical activity. weight management is crucial for overall health and diabetes prevention. 9. monitoring blood sugar levels: regularly monitor blood sugar levels, especially if you have risk factors for diabetes. early detection and intervention are key in preventing the progression to type 2 diabetes. 10. medications (if prescribed): - if prescribed by a healthcare provider, take medications as directed. medications may be recommended for individuals at high risk of developing diabetes. preventing type 2 diabetes involves making consistent and sustainable lifestyle changes. these measures not only reduce the risk of diabetes but also contribute to overall well-being and long-term health. individuals with specific risk factors or a family history of diabetes should work closely with healthcare providers to develop a personalized prevention plan. monitoring: blood glucose levels: regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential to track how different factors, such as diet and exercise, affect blood sugar. a1c levels: the a1c test provides an average of blood glucose levels over the past 2-3 months, offering insight into long-term glucose control. blood pressure: monitoring blood pressure is crucial, as individuals with diabetes have an increased risk of cardiovascular complications. cholesterol levels: keeping cholesterol levels in check is important for cardiovascular health, especially given the higher risk in diabetes. treatment options: oral medications: various classes of oral medications help manage blood sugar levels by improving insulin sensitivity, reducing glucose production, or aiding glucose uptake. insulin therapy: some individuals may require insulin injections to regulate blood sugar effectively. lifestyle modifications: healthy habits, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and weight management, are foundational to diabetes management. bariatric surgery: in specific cases, bariatric surgery may be considered as a treatment option. nutrition: carbohydrate counting: monitoring and managing carbohydrate intake is crucial for blood sugar control. glycemic index: understanding the glycemic index of foods helps individuals make informed choices to prevent rapid spikes in blood sugar. balanced meals: adopting a balanced and nutritious diet supports overall health and diabetes management. portion control: managing portion sizes helps regulate calorie intake and maintain stable blood sugar levels. education and support: diabetes education programs: these programs provide information and skills to individuals with diabetes for effective self-management. support groups: connecting with others facing similar challenges can provide emotional support and practical insights. lifestyle counseling: professional counseling helps individuals address behavioral aspects, set goals, and make sustainable lifestyle changes. medical professionals: 1. endocrinologist: specialization: endocrinologists are medical doctors who specialize in endocrinology, a field that focuses on the endocrine system and hormone-related disorders. diabetes falls under their expertise, as it involves the regulation of insulin, a key hormone. role in diabetes management: diagnosis: endocrinologists often play a crucial role in diagnosing diabetes, especially when the condition is complex or difficult to manage. treatment planning: they create comprehensive treatment plans tailored to the individual, considering factors like medication, insulin therapy, and lifestyle modifications. management of complications: endocrinologists are equipped to address and manage complications associated with diabetes, such as

including diabetes. role in diabetes management: meal planning: dietitians help create personalized meal plans that align with diabetes management goals, considering factors like carbohydrate counting, glycemic index, and portion control. nutritional counseling: they offer nutritional counseling to address individual dietary preferences, cultural considerations, and lifestyle factors. weight management: dietitians play a crucial role in weight management, a key component of diabetes care. 4. primary care physician: specialization: primary care physicians (pcps) are general practitioners who provide comprehensive healthcare and serve as the first point of contact for individuals seeking medical care. role in diabetes management: initial diagnosis: pcps often diagnose type 2 diabetes during routine check-ups or in response to specific symptoms. - ongoing monitoring: they play a central role in the ongoing monitoring of diabetes and related health issues through regular check-ups. coordination of care: pcps coordinate with specialists, such as endocrinologists and diabetes educators, to ensure a comprehensive and integrated approach to diabetes management. - medication management: pcps may prescribe and manage medications for diabetes, adjusting treatment plans as needed. blood glucose monitoring devices: 1. glucometer: description: a glucometer, also known as a blood glucose meter or blood sugar meter, is a portable, handheld device designed for self-monitoring of blood glucose levels. how it works: - individuals with diabetes use a lancet to prick their fingertip and obtain a small drop of blood. this blood sample is then applied to a test strip inserted into the glucometer. the glucometer analyzes the blood sample and provides a digital readout of the current blood glucose level. key features: portability: glucometers are compact and easy to carry, allowing individuals to monitor their blood glucose levels conveniently at home or on the go. rapid results: the results are typically available within seconds, enabling quick and timely adjustments to medication, diet, or activity. usage: individuals often use glucometers multiple

small sensor is inserted under the skin, usually on the abdomen. the sensor continuously measures glucose levels in the interstitial fluid (fluid between cells) and transmits this data to a monitor or a smartphone. the monitor displays real-time glucose levels and trends. key features: continuous monitoring: cgm systems provide a continuous stream of data, offering a more comprehensive view of glucose fluctuations. alerts and alarms: users can set customizable alerts for high and low glucose levels, enhancing proactive management. trend analysis: cgm devices provide graphs and trend lines, helping individuals understand how their glucose levels change over time. usage: cgm systems are typically worn for several days, up to two weeks, before requiring sensor replacement. data can be downloaded and shared with healthcare providers for comprehensive analysis. advantages: offers a more detailed and continuous picture of glucose dynamics. provides insights into how lifestyle factors impact glucose trends. limitations: - higher cost compared to traditional glucometers. requires sensor insertion beneath the skin, which may be uncomfortable for some individuals. genetic factors type 2 diabetes has a complex etiology, and both genetic and environmental factors contribute to its development. genetic factors play a significant role in determining an individual's susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. here are some key aspects related to the genetic factors of type 2 diabetes: 1. family history: inheritance: the risk of type 2 diabetes increases if there is a family history of the condition. individuals with a first-degree relative (parent or sibling) with type 2 diabetes are at a higher risk. polygenic inheritance: multiple genes contribute to diabetes risk, and it often involves polygenic inheritance, meaning that several genes collectively influence susceptibility. 2. genetic variants and mutations: common variants: there are common genetic variants associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. these variants are often identified through genome-wide association studies (gwas). rare mutations: in some cases, rare mutations in specific genes can significantly increase the risk of diabetes. examples include mutations in the hnf1 a and hnf4 a genes. 3. insulin resistance and beta cell function: genes influencing insulin sensitivity: genetic factors can impact insulin sensitivity, affecting how effectively cells respond to insulin. variations in genes like tcf7l2 are associated with insulin resistance. beta cell function genes: genes involved in the function of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, such as those encoding for proinsulin processing, can influence diabetes risk. 4. epigenetic modifications: environmental influence on gene expression: epigenetic modifications, such as dna methylation and histone modification, can influence how genes related to glucose metabolism are expressed. lifestyle and environmental factors: environmental factors, including diet and lifestyle, can interact with genetic factors and contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes. 5. interaction with lifestyle factors: gene-environment interaction: genetic factors interact with lifestyle and environmental factors, such as diet, physical activity, and obesity, influencing the overall risk of type 2 diabetes. obesity-related genes: some genes are associated with an increased risk of obesity, which is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. 6. mitochondrial dna: mitochondrial involvement: mitochondria, the energy-producing structures in cells, have their own dna. variations in mitochondrial dna have been studied in relation to type 2 diabetes. 7. ethnic and racial differences: population-specific variations: there are ethnic and racial differences in the prevalence of certain genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes. different populations may have unique genetic risk profiles. 8. genetic testing: risk prediction: genetic testing can provide information about an individual's genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. however, it's important to note that genetic testing is only one aspect of overall risk assessment, and lifestyle factors also play a significant role. since the discoveries of gregor mendel, modern biology has used genetics to study dna and rna and how the generation, expression and transmission of genetic information from generation to generation occur. genetics can be defined as the study of genes, the fundamental purpose of which is to investigate heritable traits. it is a branch of biology and is constantly evolving. it is considered that the first geneticist in history was gregor johann mendel, who developed the well-known mendelian laws that explain genetic inheritance. his experiments were with different varieties of peas. these findings were key for biology to find another way to study living organisms. genetics is very relevant, especially in determining the transmission of diseases from parents to children. we all have chromosomes, 23 inherited from the mother and 23 inherited from the father. the chromosomes contain the genes and are composed of dna, which is the code that provides the instructions. in fact, genes tell each cell how to behave. a genetic abnormality or mutation, in other words, a change in the instructions, can cause diseases or syndromes. sometimes they are mild, sometimes moderate and sometimes severe, depending on the case. genetics has several branches, such as classical genetics, developmental genetics and molecular genetics, among others. the cases of diabetes in the philippines is on the rise while it’s difficult to establish precisely how the prevalence rate of dm has been increasing through the years, some diabetes statistics in the philippines can still give us a clear picture. for instance, a year cohort study from 1998 to 2009 showed an alarming growth of diabetes in our country. additionally, in the 7th national nutrition and health survey (nnhs) of 2008, the researchers found out that the prevalence rate of diabetes in our country was 4.8%. five years later, in the 8th nnhs, the prevalence rate increased by 0.6%. suffice to say, filipino doctors agree that the cases of diabetes in our country are steadily on the rise and that we need more aggressive measures for management and prevention. the risk factors of diabetes in the philippines based on a 2016 data, the world health organization reported that the related risk factors for diabetes in the philippines are being overweight, obesity, and physical inactivity. the same who report shows that: 3% of filipinos are overweight, while 4.7% are obese. 7% of filipinos are physically inactive additionally, the food and nutrition research institute (fnri), in their 2018 expanded national nutrition survey (enns), also said the prevalence rates of adult overweight and obesity are 28.8% and 9.8%, respectively. although the researchers only surveyed 8 metro manila cities, they indicated that these figures are already at a national level. interestingly, they also noted an increasing prevalence of physical inactivity among filipino adults. whats causing these concerning facts and figures about being overweight, obesity, and physical inactivity among filipinos? the top contributing factors for increased diabetes risk reports show that the reasons why filipinos have an increased risk for diabetes are: 1. dependence on electronic gadgets in a review entitled, diabetes care in the philippines, the author mentioned that the rapid urbanization significantly contributes to the rise in the diabetes statistics in the philippines. this is because with urbanization or modernization comes our increasing dependence on electronic gadgets. and although electronic devices bring a lot of information, convenience, and entertainment, they also pose some health risks. for instance, various studies have already noted that excessive use of gadgets like smartphones and laptops can lead to a sedentary lifestyle a significant risk factor for diabetes mellitus. 2. traditional diet of white rice another contributing factor for the filipinos increased risk for diabetes is the traditional diet of white rice. as in most asian countries, rice is one of our food staples. traditionally, filipinos will have at least a cup of rice per meal. our love for rice has even given birth to the famous extra rice and unli rice cultures. the problem is, some studies have already identified that eating white rice regularly can increase our diabetes risk by up to 1.5%. 3. challenged medical care another contributing factor to the increased risk of diabetes in the philippines is the healthcare system. in the review, diabetes care in the philippines, the author mentioned that our national insurance system does not offer comprehensive diabetes care in a preventive model. moreover, private insurance companies often only have limited diabetes care packages. this challenge in our medical care only means that filipinos often have to rely on out-of-pocket expenses for their diabetes medical needs, like diagnostic tests and daily medications. current diabetes management in the philippines as of now, the doh has been taking measures to curb the rising diabetes statistics in the philippines. the doh’s nationwide efforts in preventing and controlling diabetes and its complications include: free diabetes risk screening at barangay health stations, health centers, and local and provincial hospitals. free medications like oral anti-diabetes drugs and insulin to filipinos diagnosed with diabetes empowering the primary healthcare workers on how to manage diabetes properly. but, despite these efforts, researchers understand that the best investment is still prevention. this is because once diagnosed with diabetes, a person already runs the risk of suffering its complications. these diabetes complications can worsen the patients overall health and financial status. key takeaways various reports indicate that the prevalence rate of diabetes in the philippines is steadily rising. according to the who, the related risk factors for diabetes in our country are being overweight, obesity, and physical inactivity. filipinos have increased risk for diabetes mainly due to our increasing dependence on electronic gadgets that lead to a sedentary lifestyle, our attachment to the traditional diet that includes white rice as a food staple, and the challenges that our healthcare system faces when it comes to diabetes care. management tips diabetes management basics if you have been diagnosed with diabetes, there is no need to worry. diabetes can be managed, and people who have either type 1 or type 2 diabetes can live long and healthy lives. tips for diabetes management: 1. make sure to eat healthy. there are no recommended diets for people with diabetes, but its important to eat foods that are low in fat and calories, but high in vitamins and nutrients. a diet high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, and olive oil is associated with reduced risk of diabetes. consulting a nutritionist may also help. 2. avoiding eating too many sweets. since you want to keep your blood sugar in check, being careful about your sugar intake is very important. eating sweets would be fine, so long as it is done in moderation, and only in small portions. 3. engage in daily exercise. exercise helps keep your body strong and healthy, and also lowers your blood sugar. this is because when you exercise, your body uses the sugar in your blood and converts it to energy. 4. monitor your blood sugar levels. this is especially important for those diagnosed with type 1 diabetes since it helps you know if your blood sugar is within the ideal range. for type 2 sufferers, it lets you know how well you're managing your blood sugar. 5. don’t forget to take insulin. insulin therapy is necessary for type 1 sufferers, since they will die if they don’t take insulin regularly. for type 2 sufferers, it would depend on the doctors recommendation. 6. don’t forget your other medication. there are some cases where your doctor will ask you to take other types of medication to help manage your condition. taking these medicines on schedule helps you manage your condition better. diabetes mellitus diabetes mellitus is a chronic and possibly incapacitating condition that is prevalent in the philippines. there are two types of diabetes: type and type 2. type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune, childhood-onset disease wherein an individual does not produce insulin. it affects about 500,000 children 14 years and below and this number is said to be rising by 3% annually. type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, is a metabolic disorder due to insulin resistance. this type of diabetes is said to affect 20.6% or one out of every five filipinos who are 30 years old and above. because of the continuous increase of the number of people afflicted with this condition, a lot of attention has been given to its prevention and cure. gene variations that signal disease sequences in diabetes are of special interest to the diabetes study group. specialists are working together to discover the link between genes and the environment that lead to diabetes and its complications. the group has looked at associations between genetic problems (mutations and polymorphisms) and diabetes among filipinos. type 2 diabetes mellitus what is it? type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) is a chronic, metabolic disorder that presents with hyperglycemia, which refers to a condition of elevated sugar levels in the blood. this disease is brought about by abnormalities in the secretion of insulin, which is a vital hormone responsible for the regulation of blood sugar levels. in patients with t2dm, there is also an increase in the production of glucose, or sugar, from the liver. a key phenomenon in t2dm is the presence of insulin resistance, which refers to an impairment in the uptake of glucose in skeletal muscles and peripheral tissues, resulting to hyperglycemia. who are at risk to have it? some individuals may have an increased risk for developing t2dm. these people are those who are overweight or obese, those with impaired fasting glucose level, those with high levels of triglycerides and those with conditions such as hypertension or a high blood pressure, schizophrenia, acanthosis nigricans and polycystic ovary syndrome. having a sedentary lifestyle is also a risk factor for developing t2dm. women who had a history of diabetes during pregnancy, or gestational diabetes mellitus, have as much as a 60% lifetime risk of developing type 2 diabetes. a family history of diabetes mellitus is also a risk factor for acquiring t2dm. individuals who are afflicted with these risk factors must be screened for the presence of t2dm in a timely manner. if you don't have any of the above risk factors, it is recommended for filipinos to be screened starting at the age of 40 years old. what are its symptoms? commonly, patients with t2dm may not experience any bothersome symptoms and the disease would simply be detected on a routine laboratory examination. individuals with high blood sugar levels may experience increased thirst (polydipsia), more frequent urination (polyuria), and excessive urination at night (polydipsia). weight loss is a sign of uncontrolled diabetes, which reflects the deficiency of insulin. people living with diabetes must be on the look-out for more serious symptoms such as blurring of vision, frothy urine (bubbly urine), tingling sensation of the feeling of having pins and needles on the hands and feet, leg pain and abdominal discomfort and pain because these may be indicative of the presence of the multi-systemic complications of diabetes. wounds that take a long time to heal, especially on the feet, may be found in people with diabetes. how is it diagnosed? t2dm is diagnosed by requesting laboratory examinations. recommended screening test is fasting blood sugar. if the level is 126 mg/dl (7 mmol/l) or higher on 2 separate occasions is already considered to have t2 dm. other tests that your doctor might request are 75 grams oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt) and hb a1c, which is your average blood sugar levels for the past 3 months. how is it treated? proper nutrition and a healthy lifestyle are crucial pillars in the management of t2 dm. a well-balanced diet consisting mostly of vegetables, legumes, lentils, noodles, rice, bread, grains, and non-sweet fresh fruits, with moderate amounts of protein-rich food such as fish, seafoods, eggs, lean meat, skin-less chicken, low-fat cheese, low-fat yogurt, and nuts. sugar-sweetened beverages and foods that have a high salt, sugar, and fat content should be avoided. a person living with diabetes should not skip meals. exercise is a vital aspect in maintaining a healthy lifestyle for persons with diabetes. moderate intensity exercise, as tolerated by the individual, for about 150 minutes per week, at least thirty minutes per day on most days of the week, is highly recommended. 4 health protocols must be observed when performing such aerobic activity during this time of the covid-19 pandemic. outdoor exercises, such as running, walking, jogging, and biking, are preferred. gardening, which is also a gratifying activity that has become popular during the quarantine period, also helps burn calories. t2dm may be treated by medications in the form of oral anti-hyperglycemic agents, such as metformin, which belongs to the class of drugs called biguanides, sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl-peptidase inhibitors, and other medications such as pioglitazone and acarbose. some patients need to be treated with insulin injections. it is crucial to regularly consult with the doctor so you can be advised on the most appropriate treatment for you. what are its complications? various organs of the body may be affected by t2dm. in long-standing t2dm, the blood vessels of the eyes may be involved, in a condition called diabetic retinopathy. persons living with t2dm must undergo an eye exam upon diagnosis of their condition. diabetes may also have a detrimental effect on the kidney's filtering ability, leading to a condition known as diabetic nephropathy. the nerves of the legs and feet may also be damaged as part of the complication of diabetes, and may present as numbness, pain, or tingling sensation of the lower extremities, referred to as diabetic neuropathy. persons living with diabetes should examine their feet daily for the presence of wounds. retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy are all known as microvascular complications of diabetes. diabetes may also cause narrowing of the large blood vessels of the body from inflammation and injury, giving rise to a condition known as atherosclerosis, which fuels the macrovascular complications of diabetes, which can be in the form of heart disease, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease. persons with diabetes should consistently follow-up with their physicians so that they could be regularly monitored for the presence of complications and could be treated in a timely manner. when do you need to see an endocrinologist? it is recommended that persons with diabetes who have high blood sugar levels, with bothersome symptoms, and complications should see an endocrinologist. those who need insulin therapy would also benefit from an endocrinology consult. type 2 diabetes in the filipino: is it any different? anyone can get diabetes young or old, rich or poor, male or female, filipino or not. in the philippines, according to the food and nutrition research institute-department of science and technology 8th national nutrition survey, diabetes prevalence based on fasting blood sugar has risen from 3.4 percent in 2003 to 5.4 percent in 2013. the greatest numbers of filipinos with diabetes are 50 to 69 years of age and wealthy and live in urban areas. not surprising since type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) is both a genetic and a lifestyle disease linked to aging, unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, obesity and urbanization. about 90 to 95 percent of people with diabetes have t2 dm. risk factors include: age at or above 30 years, family history of diabetes, high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, polycystic ovary syndrome, gestational or pregnancy-related diabetes, intake of certain drugs, and sleep deprivation. people who were born premature, too heavy (>/= 8 pounds) or too small are also at risk for t2dm. type 2 diabetes is characterized by impairment in insulin secretion or action, which can lead to high blood sugar. high blood sugar can wreak havoc in the body circulation and immune system leading to infections, blindness, kidney failure, leg amputation, heart attacks and strokes. filipinos are especially prone to t2dm compared to other races. in fact, filipinos get diabetes and problems like hypertension, high cholesterol and heart disease at a lower body mass index (bmi) compared to caucasians. a person’s bmi is calculated by dividing one's body weight in kilograms by the square of one’s height in meters. a bmi of 25 and above is considered overweight for caucasians, while a bmi of 23 and above is the cutoff for asians. one possible reason for the higher t2dm risk is that filipinos have more visceral fat despite having similar bmi or waistlines as their caucasian counterparts. visceral fat is the nasty fat inside the belly stored in or around the internal organs such as the liver, pancreas and intestines, which can lead to defective insulin action. in studies done in north america, filipino migrants have even been found to have higher rates of t2dm compared to other asians such as the japanese, chinese, korean and vietnamese. to add insult to injury, studies suggest that filipinos may also have more diabetes complications like eye and kidney disease compared to other races. but pinoys need not sulk about getting the short end of the stick. filipino or not, you can cut your diabetes risk. just eat right, move more, stay trim, sleep well, stress less and get checked. dr. joy arabelle fontanilla is the past president of the american association of clinical endocrinologists philippine chapter and head of the weight management center, st. lukes medical center-global city. the a to z of health information advocacy is a joint initiative of a group of medical specialists and supported by astra zeneca philippines aimed at raising public awareness on various diseases and providing health information and updates to the healthcare community. why do filipinos have high rates of diabetes? not-so-fun facts: in the united states, 15.8% of filipino men as opposed to 6.1% of the overall male population have type 2 diabetes. filipina women are six times more likely than white women to have type 2 diabetes while controlling for diabetes risk factors. although filipinos have higher rates of obesity a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes compared to the overall u.s. population, even non-obese filipinos are more likely to acquire type 2 diabetes. overconsumption of refined carbohydrates i.e., white rice can raise blood glucose levels and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. however, qualitative studies have found that filipinos who reduce white rice intake are socially viewed as rejecting filipino culture. these findings exemplify how difficult it is for filipinos to make the necessary dietary changes to reduce their risk of type 2 diabetes. a simple way to help keep blood glucose stable is to fill your plate with 50% veggies, 25% rice, and 25% protein. the filipino guide to natural diabetes management resiliency, hospitality, and strong family ties are some of the most vivid qualities of the typical filipino. but i believe there is no filipino trait more unparalleled than their love for food no wonder headlines have it that the philippines is a diabetes hotspot in the pacific. the number of diabetes cases in the country is climbing up each year as many of our countrymen are spending a lot of money and energy on maintenance therapy for it. many of the drugs are available and accessible, but many are their adverse effects and costs, too. this is why a portion of our population still believes and depends on natural therapy. although the newest medicines in the market are potent and promising, natural therapy can (and may) also be good and effective even modern science is a witness to this. here are a few ideas on beating diabetes the natural and non-chemical way: aloe vera even your teenage daughter or your niece in eighth grade knows that aloe vera is in her everyday hair shampoo or in her favorite skin care product. but do they or even you know that it may also help your 60-year-old mom with her diabetes? according to studies, aloe vera has the potential of lowering blood sugar and boosting up insulin. in the market, aloe vera for diabetes comes in powders, extracts, and juices. cinnamon it may be your typical spice in the kitchen, but it may also be your next step in beating diabetes. studies have it that cinnamon can reduce sugar levels as well as lower body mass, body fat, and blood pressure (which are very known risk factors of the disease). visit your doctor and talk to them about taking cinnamon as your everyday supplement for diabetes. bitter gourd is not a kid's usual vegetable of choice, but it is and should be on the diet of any diabetic filipino out there. bitter gourd or ampalaya in filipino is one of 10 philippine herbal medicines. it is also a known supplement for diabetes due to its properties of reducing sugar levels and improving sugar tolerance. bitter is the taste, but better is the diabetic patient with this veggie on his or her menu. fenugreek an ingredient in cuisines, a component of feeds, a medicine to man, fenugreek is one of the world's all-purpose herbs with all-around functions, especially in managing diabetes. it is known to bring down sugar digestion, increase insulin levels, and decrease the amount of cholesterol in the body. you can grab it in the market and drink it as tea, eat it as food, or gulp it as a capsule to keep your sugar levels on the right track. this herb is a newbie in the market. one interesting thing worth remembering about gymnema is that it means sugar destroyer in hindi. it is a great help in dealing with diabetes as it reduces sugar cravings, lowers sugar levels, increases insulin production, and fights the aggravating factors of the disease. this sugar destroyer is available in stores as a supplement in different capsule forms. 6. ginseng from the ancient era of kings and emperors to this present time of smartphones and social media, ginseng has always been a legendary plant with equally legendary health benefits. it is a popular and proven antioxidant and booster of immunity, energy and brain functions. as a diabetes supplement, it improves and enhances insulin production, sugar uptake, and pancreatic function and it comes in the form of tea, food, and pharmaceutical products in the market. serpentina another herb in folk medicine that has been addressing several ailments in the community is serpentina. studies show that this plant is able to carry out a multitude of actions in the human body, one of which is its antidiabetic power. it is easily and readily at hand in the form of supplements at your nearest drugstores. the king of bitters these seven plants are just tidbits of the hundreds of natural products out there claiming and proving themselves to be treatments and preventions of various sicknesses, from the simplest colds to the severest cancer. with a lot of choices on the list, which one is a really good deal for diabetes? andrographis paniculata, like any other herbal product out there, is known and believed to have a wide range of effects for a wide range of sicknesses. simply known as serpentina, sinta, or king of bitters, it is a plant hailing from southeast asia with india and sri lanka as its primary native homes. it is a branched herb with a life cycle of one year and a height of half to one meter, having green and lanceolate leaves. serpentina has been in traditional medicine for many years, preventing and addressing infection, inflammation, and cancer. studies have it that this plant is a useful aid in diarrhea, diabetes, and conditions of the kidney and the liver. it has antioxidant, anti-fever, and immunostimulant effects in the human body, causing its ability to combat and prevent different maladies. so how does serpentina exactly work its magic on diabetes? or the better question is, can serpentina really work its magic on diabetes? there is actually a sufficient number of researches supporting the effectiveness of this plant in lowering blood sugar levels in the body. this action of serpentina is due to andrographolide. this substance is responsible for improving sugar uptake by adipose tissues, hinders the liver from making sugar, and halts the intestine from taking it in. all these actions of the andrographolide boil down to a subsequent decrease in the level of sugar in the blood, which is the main goal of therapy in treating any diabetic patient. on top of science is the rich history of the plant. serpentina has a huge part in traditional asian medicine the use of it is prevalent and patronized in india, sri lanka, pakistan, malaysia, indonesia, china, and thailand. it is also a common herbal remedy in the ayurvedic and unani systems of medicine. as a result, a lot of medicinal products containing serpentina are out in the market, sold and bought for its antidiabetic ability. a large chunk of these herbal preparations come in the form of powders and capsules for easy and quick consumption. how to manage and prevent diabetes for filipinos? diabetes is a disease that impacts in 5 people in the philippines. worldwide, about 537 million adults aged 20 to 79 years old are affected a number expected to increase by 50% in 20 years. it has afflicted over a million young people who are 19 years old and below, and nearly half of diabetic adults remain undiagnosed due to lack of information about this disease. diabetes management: you may wonder, how does living with the disease feel like? since the causes of type 1 and 2 diabetes differ, so do their management. people with type 1 diabetes, where the pancreas can no longer produce insulin. the patient will have to administer the hormone externally for energy and blood glucose control. doctors will pick from 5 types of insulin rapid-acting, short-acting, intermediate-acting, long-acting, and premix and recommend their dose and frequency. while type 2 diabetes may also require insulin at a later stage, treatment usually starts out with dietary and lifestyle intervention (improving their eating habits and embarking on an exercise program). if changes in diet becomes inadequate in managing blood sugar levels, then oral medication will be prescribed to manage blood sugar levels. diabetic diet: diabetic patients should follow the treatment solutions prescribed by their doctor to actively manage the disease and reduce the risk of complications. all patients should follow dietary treatment. as different people have varying calorie requirements, patients should consult a registered dietician to design a suitable menu for the management of the disease and stabilizing glucose. the general guidelines are as follows: have a balanced diet and have your meals at a regular time. also, dieticians and doctors may also advise patients eat less per meal but have more meals. this helps in stabilizing blood glucose levels. your diet should have a healthy and appropriate mix of carbohydrates. carbohydrates should be approximately 50% of the total calorie intake. for example, around 750 kcal of calories (equivalent to around 188g carbohydrate, i.e., of 18 - 19 portions of carbohydrate exchange) to be produced by carbohydrate in a 1500 kcal menu. the above carbohydrate exchange should be distributed evenly in main meals and snack time. 1 portion of carbohydrate exchange is equivalent to 10g of carbohydrate. patients can choose suitable number of grains, rhizome vegetables, fruits, and dairy according to the carbohydrate exchange method. dietary counselling would include emphasis on the avoidance of food and drinks that are rich in sugar or additional sweeteners to prevent surge of glucose as much as possible. foods that are high in saturated fat content such as animal organs should also be avoided to protect the cardiovascular system. abstinence of alcohol should also be followed as alcohol consumption can affect the efficacy of drugs and may lead to low blood glucose (hypoglycemia). in unavoidable circumstances, men and women should limit themselves to 2 and 1 portions respectively. each portion works out to be 300ml of beer, 150ml of red wine, or 45ml of spirit, depending on one's choice of a nightcap. oral anti-diabetic drugs (oad): the prescriptions of oral anti-diabetic drugs will be given by doctor according to the body condition, drug allergies (if any) and condition of blood glucose control of individual patient. type: sulfonylureas function: stimulate the insulin secretion of pancreas example: tolbutamide, gliclazide, gliclazide mr, glimepiride, glipizide type: biguanides function: reduce the production of glucose in liver, increase the application of glucose by body tissue (muscles) and reduce the absorption of glucose in gastrointestinal tract example: metformin, metformin xr type: glucosidase inhibitors function: slow down the absorption of dextrose in small intestine to prevent too much glucose after meals example: acarbose type: glitazones function: increase the sensitivity of body to insulin so glucose would enter the cells and decrease the glucose level. example: pioglitazone type: dipeptidyl peptidase-4 enzyme inhibitors function: stimulate the insulin secretion of pancreas example: sitagliptin, vildagliptin, linagliptin, saxagliptin, alogliptin type: meglitinides or glinides function: stimulate the insulin secretion of pancreas example: repaglinide type: sglt2-inhibitors function: inhibit reabsorption of glucose in the kidney and lower blood sugar, e.g., empagliflozin, dapagliflozin example: dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, canagliflozin insulin injections for diabetes: insulin is a hormone required by the body to use glucose for energy and helps balance your blood glucose levels. for type 1dm and late-stage type 2dm where the pancreas can longer produce insulin, diabetics would have to administer insulin externally to help regulate blood sugar levels. injection of insulin is a way similar to the normal secretion of insulin to manage glucose. this treatment is applied to type 1 patients and some of the type 2 patients whose glucose level cannot be managed after application of oral hypoglycemic medications. injection of insulin can be classified into 5 durations of action of insulin, it would be rapid acting, short acting, intermediate acting, long acting and pre-mix insulin. the doctors will generally decide the type, dose of insulin and the frequency of injection required, and the injection can be done by the patients themselves after training. diabetes complications: if not well managed, the continued presence of high sugar levels in the bloodstream can lead to complications over time. the complications differ from those suffering from type 1 and type 2 diabetes. acute complications of type 1 diabetes: type 1 diabetes sufferers tend to experience the consequences of high glucose levels quickly as compared to type 2 diabetics. leaving high blood sugar levels to chance jeopardizes the metabolism of fat and protein, which doesn’t bode well, especially for type 1 diabetics. where insulin is scarce, the body breaks fat down into fuel. this creates a buildup of ketone bodies which can potentially cause ketoacidosis and life-threatening cases of diabetic coma. patients could also experience glycosuria, where sugars are passed out during urination; as well as excessive urination (polyuria) and extreme thirst (polydipsia) arising from dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. chronic complications for type 2 diabetes: the complications of type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, put systems and organs at risk of destruction. as high blood sugar levels persist, patients are more vulnerable to cardiovascular diseases, kidney failure, or damage to one’s tissues and nerves. the latter can result in retinopathy leading to visual impairment and foot diseases such as ulcers, infections, and gangrene which may warrant lower limb amputation. unsurprisingly, foot care is a big part of living with type 2 diabetes. maintaining foot hygiene is the bare minimum, along with regular examination lest cuts and wounds on numb limbs go undetected. for the same reason, patients should never go barefoot, trim their toenails with care, and have calluses removed professionally. exercise should be limited to feet-friendly activities and investing in footwear that fits well and promotes blood circulation will prove worthwhile. diabetes prevention: as the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of care. living with diabetes is a huge undertaking, and its wiser to be more proactive than reactive. regular exercise and dietary management are two cornerstones of diabetes prevention, but what do these look like in practice? for adults get 75 and 150 minutes of exercise of moderate and vigorous intensities respectively per week. that said, those who are gunning for a healthy bmi could use more activity. during mealtimes, choose complex over processed carbohydrates; poultry, fish, and plant-based protein over red meat; and water, coffee, and tea over sugary drinks. home-cooked meals are also a good idea if you’re using healthier fats and oils made with olives, avocados, and nuts. aside from working out and eating well, here are 3 other lifestyle adjustments that will keep you out of the woods. understanding diabetes: the bad news is that there’s no proven cure for diabetes. the good news? prediabetes can be mitigated. as you would have learned by now, blood sugar levels sit front and center in diabetes management, treatment, and prevention. now that you know the risks, causes, and manifestations of diabetes, you can be more conscious about your diet, exercise regime, and health screenings. chronic illnesses like diabetes can turn critical because of possible complications and lifetime management. whether you’re at risk or not, being financially prepared is key to protecting your savings and investments from being wiped out in case of illness. aside from philhealth and hmo, you can add products such as sunfit and well to help cover the costs of prevention, diagnosis, recovery, and treatment. you may also ask a sun life financial advisor to know more health protection plans that fit your budget. type 2 diabetes is a condition that happens because of a problem in the way the body regulates and uses sugar as a fuel. that sugar also is called glucose. this long-term condition results in too much sugar circulating in the blood. eventually, high blood sugar levels can lead to disorders of the circulatory, nervous and immune systems. in type 2 diabetes, there are primarily two problems. the pancreas does not produce enough insulin a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into the cells. and cells respond poorly to insulin and take in less sugar. type 2 diabetes used to be known as adult-onset diabetes, but both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can begin during childhood and adulthood. type 2 is more common in older adults. but the increase in the number of children with obesity has led to more cases of type 2 diabetes in younger people. there's no cure for type 2 diabetes. losing weight, eating well and exercising can help manage the disease. if diet and exercise aren't enough to control blood sugar, diabetes medications or insulin therapy may be recommended. what is diabetes? diabetes is a chronic illness that is a result of having excessive glucose (sugar) in your bloodstream. the primary cause of this disease is when the pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels which in turn causes a spike in your blood sugar. having diabetes can put you at risk for other chronic ailments like heart disease, vision problems, and even impotence in men. what are the kinds of diabetes? type 1 diabetes is also known as insulin-dependent diabetes or juvenile diabetes. this is considered to be more dangerous than type 2 diabetes and typically occurs in children and young adults. while the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is still unknown, family medical history can also be a risk factor in 10% to 15% of patients diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. those with other known autoimmune hormone-related diseases are also prone to developing this type of diabetes. meanwhile, those with type 2 diabetes or adult-onset diabetes are usually diagnosed after the age of 40. about 90% to 95% of those with diabetes have this kind of diabetes. according to some studies, type 2 diabetes has slowly become one of the fastest growing epidemics in this modern age. obese children are also at risk of developing this type of diabetes as unhealthy food options are more readily accessible and affordable for the masses. common symptoms you should consider consulting your doctor if you experience any of the following symptoms which may indicate early signs of diabetes like: unexpected weight loss slow healing wounds blurred vision frequent urination unexplained fatigue how do you get diagnosed? your doctor may perform blood tests to measure and determine the type of diabetes and the severity of your condition. a urine test may also be necessary to see if there are any abnormalities in your ketone levels which is usually a result of low insulin levels in your blood. general disclaimer always consults your doctor before drinking any kind of medication, including vitamins. keep in mind that your physician is in the best position to prescribe the right kind of treatment for your condition. immediately stop using a product if you experience negative side effects. type 2 diabetes (t2dm) type 2 diabetes, or t2dm is the most common form of diabetes mellitus. where type 1 diabetes occurs due to a lack of insulin secretion in the body, type 2 diabetes is caused by the inefficient use of insulin or faulty signaling in the cells, also known as insulin resistance. common symptoms of type 2 diabetes t2dm is also known as a silent disease with less noticeable symptoms, especially in the very beginning. overtime, the symptoms that appear share some similarities with type 1 diabetes. if your blood glucose level has been high for a prolonged period of time, these are the symptoms that may appear. yeast infections yeast thrives off glucose. A high blood glucose level is conducive for yeast to thrive, resulting in yeast infections. these infections can grow in any warm, moist fold of skin such as between fingers and toes, under the breasts and in or around sex organs. slow-healing sores or wounds prolonged periods of high blood sugar can also affect your blood flow. this causes nerve damage that makes it hard for your body to regenerate and heal from cuts and other wounds. pain or numbness in the feet or legs pain and numbness in your lower limbs may also be another sign of nerve damage. causes of type 2 diabetes type 2 diabetes is largely a product of weight gain from a rich diet and sedentary lifestyle. other risk factors include age and family history of diabetes, though these play a smaller role.
