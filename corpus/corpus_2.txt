Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic condition that affects the way your body metabolizes sugar (glucose), an important source of fuel for the body. in type 2 diabetes, your body either resists the effects of insulin a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into your cells or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels. what causes type 2 diabetes? the main cause of type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance. insulin resistance happens when cells in your muscles, fat and liver don’t respond as they should to insulin. insulin is a hormone your pancreas makes that’s essential for life and regulating blood sugar levels. if your body isn't responding to insulin properly, your pancreas has to make more insulin to try to overcome your increasing blood glucose levels (hyperinsulinemia). if your cells become too resistant to insulin and your pancreas can’t make enough insulin to overcome it, it leads to type 2 diabetes. several factors can contribute to insulin resistance, including: genetics. excess body fat, especially in your belly and around your organs (visceral fat). physical inactivity. eating highly processed, high-carbohydrate foods and saturated fats frequently. certain medications, like long-term corticosteroid use. hormonal disorders, like hypothyroidism and cushing syndrome. chronic stress and a lack of quality sleep. what is insulin? insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, a gland located behind the stomach. it plays a crucial role in regulating blood sugar (glucose) levels. when you eat, your digestive system breaks down carbohydrates into glucose, which enters the bloodstream. in response to rising blood sugar levels, the pancreas releases insulin. the main functions of insulin include: facilitating glucose uptake: insulin enables cells in the muscles, fat, and liver to absorb glucose from the bloodstream. this allows cells to use glucose for energy. inhibiting glucose production: insulin suppresses the liver's production of glucose. between meals, when blood sugar levels drop, the pancreas reduces insulin secretion, and the liver releases stored glucose to maintain normal blood sugar levels. promoting glycogen synthesis: insulin helps convert excess glucose into glycogen, a form of stored glucose, in the liver and muscles. this stored glycogen can be released when energy is needed. inhibiting fat breakdown: insulin also plays a role in inhibiting the breakdown of fats in fat cells. when insulin levels are high, the body tends to store excess calories as fat. in type 2 diabetes, the body may not use insulin effectively, leading to insulin resistance. this can result in the pancreas producing more insulin to compensate, but over time, it may not be enough to regulate blood sugar levels, leading to elevated glucose in the bloodstream. maintaining proper insulin function is essential for overall health, and disruptions in insulin production or utilization can lead to conditions like diabetes. management of diabetes often involves strategies to regulate insulin levels, either through lifestyle modifications, medications, or insulin therapy. insulin resistance: in type 2 diabetes, the body's cells become resistant to the action of insulin. insulin is needed to allow sugar (glucose) to enter cells for energy. when cells resist insulin's signal, glucose builds up in the bloodstream, leading to high blood sugar levels. causes and risk factors: genetics: family history of diabetes can increase the risk. certain ethnic groups (e.g., african american, hispanic, native american) are more prone. weight: being overweight or obese is a significant risk factor. physical inactivity: lack of exercise can contribute to insulin resistance. unhealthy diet: high consumption of processed foods, sugary beverages, and a lack of fiber. medical conditions: metabolic syndrome: a cluster of conditions (abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low hdl cholesterol) increases diabetes risk. polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos): common in women and associated with insulin resistance. age and gender: risk increases with age, especially after 45. women with a history of gestational diabetes are at higher risk. symptoms: early symptoms: increased thirst (polydipsia) and hunger: experiencing excessive thirst and hunger. frequent urination: needing to urinate often, especially at night. fatigue: feeling tired and lethargic. tingling or numbness in your hands or feet dry skin. unexplained weight loss. advanced symptoms: blurred vision. slow wound healing. recurrent infections. people assigned female at birth (afab) may experience frequent vaginal yeast infections and/or urinary tract infections (utis). if you have these symptoms, it's important to see your healthcare provider. simple blood tests can diagnose t2 d. diagnosis: blood tests: fasting blood sugar, oral glucose tolerance test, and a1c test. symptoms and clinical signs: your doctor may consider your symptoms and overall health. management: lifestyle changes: healthy diet, regular exercise, weight management. medications: oral medications or insulin therapy may be prescribed. monitoring: regular blood sugar monitoring is important. complications: untreated or poorly managed type 2 diabetes can lead to serious complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, nerve damage, and vision problems. cardiovascular complications: increased risk of heart disease and stroke. hypertension often accompanies diabetes. microvascular complications: nephropathy (kidney disease). neuropathy (nerve damage). retinopathy (vision problems). foot complications: peripheral neuropathy increases the risk of foot ulcers and amputations. management: lifestyle modifications: healthy diet emphasizing whole foods, fruits, vegetables, and fiber. regular physical activity. weight management. medications: oral medications (e.g., metformin) to improve insulin sensitivity. insulin therapy if oral medications are insufficient. blood sugar monitoring: regular monitoring to track blood glucose levels. education and support: diabetes education on self-care and management. emotional support for coping with the psychological aspects of diabetes. prevention: healthy lifestyle: adopting a healthy diet and regular exercise. maintaining a healthy weight. regular check-ups: regular health check-ups to monitor blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and cholesterol. public health implications: global impact: rising prevalence worldwide, associated with urbanization and lifestyle changes. healthcare costs: substantial economic burden due to healthcare costs and productivity loss. what is obesity? obesity is a medical condition characterized by the accumulation of excessive body fat to the extent that it may have a negative impact on health. it is often defined by body mass index (bmi), which is a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of their height in meters. a bmi of 30 or higher is generally considered indicative of obesity. 1. bmi categories: underweight: bmi less than 18.5 normal weight: bmi18.5 to 24.9 overweight: bmi25 to 29.9 obesity: bmi30 or higher 2. causes: caloric imbalance: obesity typically results from consuming more calories than the body uses, leading to the storage of excess energy as fat. genetics: genetic factors can influence an individual's predisposition to obesity. environmental factors: factors such as unhealthy diets, sedentary lifestyles, and lack of access to nutritious foods can contribute. 3. health risks: obesity is associated with an increased risk of various health conditions, including: type 2 diabetes cardiovascular diseases (heart disease and stroke) certain types of cancer sleep apnea osteoarthritis respiratory problems mental health issues 4. prevention and management: adopting a healthy, balanced diet with appropriate portion sizes. engaging in regular physical activity. behavioral interventions and counseling. medical treatments and, in some cases, bariatric surgery for severe obesity. 5. global prevalence: obesity has become a global health concern, affecting people of all ages and socioeconomic backgrounds. the prevalence of obesity has risen significantly in recent decades. 6. stigma and discrimination: individuals with obesity may face societal stigma and discrimination, affecting their mental and emotional well-being. 7. childhood obesity: childhood obesity is a particular concern, as it can lead to health issues later in life. addressing obesity often requires a multifaceted approach, involving changes in diet, increased physical activity, behavioral modifications, and sometimes medical interventions. it's essential to recognize obesity as a complex health issue with various contributing factors and to approach its prevention and management with a comprehensive and individualized strategy. what is high triglycerides? triglycerides are a type of fat (lipid) found in your blood. when you eat, your body converts any calories it doesn't need to use right away into triglycerides. these triglycerides are stored in fat cells for later use. while your body needs triglycerides for energy, having too high a level of triglycerides in your blood can be a risk factor for various health issues. normal triglyceride levels: normal: less than 150 milligrams per deciliter (mg/d l) borderline high: 150 to 199 mg/dl high: 200 to 499 mg/dl very high: 500 mg/d lor higher causes of high triglycerides: 1. unhealthy diet: diets high in saturated fats, trans fats, and refined carbohydrates can contribute to elevated triglyceride levels. 2. lack of physical activity: sedentary lifestyles and lack of regular exercise can lead to higher triglyceride levels. 3. obesity: being overweight or obese is often associated with higher triglyceride levels. 4. insulin resistance and diabetes: insulin resistance and diabetes can lead to increased triglycerides. 5. genetics: some people may have a genetic predisposition to higher triglyceride levels. 6. certain medical conditions: hypothyroidism, kidney disease, and liver disease can contribute to elevated triglycerides. 7. alcohol consumption: excessive alcohol intake can raise triglyceride levels. health risks associated with high triglycerides: 1. cardiovascular disease: high triglycerides, especially when combined with low levels of hdl cholesterol, can contribute to atherosclerosis (hardening and narrowing of the arteries) and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. 2. pancreatitis: extremely high levels of triglycerides can lead to inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), a serious and potentially life-threatening condition. management of high triglycerides: 1. lifestyle changes: adopting a heart-healthy diet low in saturated and trans fats, and high in omega-3 fatty acids. regular physical activity. limiting alcohol intake. 2. medications: statins and other medications may be prescribed to lower triglyceride levels. 3. treatment of underlying conditions: managing underlying conditions such as diabetes or hypothyroidism. 4. regular monitoring: regular blood tests to monitor triglyceride levels. it's important to note that managing triglyceride levels is often part of an overall strategy to maintain heart health. lifestyle modifications, including a healthy diet and regular exercise, are key components of preventing and managing high triglycerides. individuals with concerns about their triglyceride levels should consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and appropriate interventions. what is low hdl cholesterol? Hdl cholesterol, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, is often referred to as "good" cholesterol. it plays a crucial role in the body by helping to remove other forms of cholesterol, specifically low-density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol (often called "bad" cholesterol), from the bloodstream. hdl cholesterol carries cholesterol away from the arteries and back to the liver, where it can be processed and eliminated. this process helps prevent the buildup of plaque in the arteries. normal hdl cholesterol levels: desirable: 60 mg/dl and above borderline: 40 to 59 mg/dl poor: less than 40 mg/dl causes of low hdl cholesterol: 1.unhealthy lifestyle: lack of physical activity and a sedentary lifestyle can contribute to low hdl cholesterol levels. 2.unhealthy diet: diets high in saturated and trans fats can lower hdl cholesterol. 3. smoking: smoking is associated with lower hdl cholesterol levels. 4.genetics: genetic factors can influence cholesterol levels, including hdl cholesterol. 5. obesity: being overweight or obese can be associated with lower hdl cholesterol. 6.certain medical conditions: type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and some rare genetic disorders can affect hdlcholesterol levels. health implications of low hdl cholesterol: 1. increased cardiovascular risk: low hdl cholesterol is considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. hdl cholesterol helps remove cholesterol from the arteries, and low levels may contribute to the buildup of plaque, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke. 2.combination with high ldl cholesterol: having both low hdl cholesterol and high ldl cholesterol can significantly elevate cardiovascular risk. management of low hdl cholesterol: 1. lifestyle changes: regular physical activity, including aerobic exercise, can help raise hdl cholesterol. adopting a heart-healthy diet that includes sources of healthy fats, such as omega-3 fatty acids. 2. quit smoking: quitting smoking can have positive effects on hdl cholesterol levels. 3. weight management: losing weight, if necessary, can improve hdl cholesterol levels. 4. medications: in some cases, medications may be prescribed to raise hdl cholesterol, although lifestyle changes are usually the first approach. it's important to note that cholesterol levels are just one aspect of cardiovascular health, and overall heart health involves a combination of factors, including blood pressure, blood sugar, and lifestyle habits. individuals concerned about their cholesterol levels should consult with a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation and personalized advice on managing their cardiovascular risk. what is hyperglycemia (high blood sugar)? hyperglycemia happens when there’s too much sugar (glucose) in your blood. It's also called high blood sugar or high blood glucose. this happens when your body has too little insulin (a hormone) or if your body can't use insulin properly (insulin resistance). hyperglycemia usually means you have diabetes, and people with diabetes can experience hyperglycemia episodes frequently. if you have hyperglycemia that's untreated for long periods of time, it can damage your nerves, blood vessels, tissues and organs. evere hyperglycemia can also lead to an acute (sudden and severe) life-threatening complication called diabetes-related ketoacidosis (dka), especially in people with diabetes who take insulin or people with undiagnosed type 1 diabetes. this requires immediate medical treatment. what is blood sugar? glucose (sugar) mainly comes from carbohydrates in the food and drinks you consume. it's your body's main source of energy. your blood carries glucose to all of your body's cells to use for energy. if you don't have diabetes, several bodily processes naturally help keep your blood glucose in a healthy range. insulin, a hormone your pancreas makes, is the most significant contributor to maintaining healthy blood sugar. high blood sugar most often happens due to a lack of insulin or insulin resistance. this leads to diabetes. people who have diabetes must use medication, like oral diabetes medications or synthetic insulin, and/or lifestyle changes to help keep their blood sugar levels in range. current diabetes statistics in the philippines according to the international diabetes federation or idf, the prevalence rate of diabetes in filipino adults is approximately 6.3%. that means that out of 63 million adults in our country, almost 4 million have diabetes. but, even with these high figures, there could be more undocumented diabetes cases in the philippines. after all, the idf didn’t include younger people in their data, and they didn’t take pre-diabetes into consideration. what’s even more alarming is that in a 2016 report, the world health organization announced that 6% of all deaths in the philippines occurred due to diabetes. is type 2 diabetes genetic? the cause of t2 dis complex, but researchers know that genetics play a strong role. your lifetime risk of developing t2 dis 40% if you have one biological parent with t2d and 70% if both of your biological parents have it. researchers have identified at least 150 dna variations linked to the risk of developing t2d some increase your risk and others decrease it. some of these variations may directly play a role in insulin resistance and insulin production. others may increase your risk of t2d by increasing your tendency to have overweight or obesity. these genetic variations likely act together with health and lifestyle factors to influence your overall risk of t2 d. what are the risk factors for type 2 diabetes? you’re more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you: have a family history of type 2 diabetes (biological parent or sibling). are older than 45. have overweight or obesity (a bmi greater than 25). are physically active less than three times a week. are black, hispanic, native american, asian american or pacific islander. had gestational diabetes while pregnant. have high blood pressure and/or high cholesterol. have prediabetes. have polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos). as t2d symptoms typically come on slowly, it’s important to see your primary care provider regularly if you're at risk for the condition. this way, they can do screenings, like a basic metabolic panel (bmp), to check on your blood sugar levels. it’s better to catch t2d earlier rather than later. diagnosis and tests how is type 2 diabetes diagnosed? the following blood tests help your healthcare provider diagnose type 2 diabetes: fasting plasma glucose test: this lab test checks your blood sugar level. you typically need to get this test in the morning after an eight-hour fast (nothing to eat or drink except water). a result of 126 mg/d lor higher means you have diabetes. random plasma glucose test: this lab test also checks your blood sugar, but you can get it at any time without fasting. a result of 200 mg/dl or higher means you have diabetes. a1c test: this lab test measures your average blood sugar levels over the past two to three months. a result of 6.5% or higher means you have diabetes. in some cases, your provider may order an autoantibody blood test to see if you have type 1 diabetes instead of t2 d. management and treatment what is the treatment for type 2 diabetes? unlike many health conditions, you mainly manage t2d on your own with medical guidance and support from your healthcare team. this could include your: primary care physician (pcp) or endocrinologist. registered dietitian. certified diabetes care and education specialist (cdces). ophthalmologist (eye doctor). dentist. your team should also include family members and other important people in your life. managing t2d can be challenging you have to make several decisions every day for it. but everything you do to improve your health is worth it. the core features of type 2 diabetes management include: lifestyle changes, like more exercise and eating adjustments. blood sugar monitoring. medication. exercise for type 2 diabetes regular activity is important for everyone. it's even more important if you have diabetes. exercise is good for your health because it: lowers your blood sugar level without medication in the short term and long term. burns calories and may help with weight loss. improves blood flow and blood pressure. increases your energy level and boosts your mood. helps with stress management. talk to your provider before starting any exercise program. you may need to take special steps before, during and after physical activity, especially if you take insulin. the general goal is to get at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity. type 2 diabetes diet ask your healthcare provider or registered dietitian to recommend a meal plan that’s right for you. what you eat, how much you eat, and when you eat are all important in keeping your blood sugar levels in the range that your healthcare team recommends. the key to eating with type 2 diabetes is to eat a variety of nutritious foods from all food groups, in the amounts your meal plan outlines. in general, these types of foods can help support healthy blood sugar levels: lean proteins, like chicken, eggs, fish and turkey. non-starchy vegetables, like broccoli, green beans, salad greens and cucumbers. healthy fats, like avocados, nuts, natural peanut butter and olive oil. complex carbohydrates, like beans, berries, sweet potatoes and whole-wheat bread. blood sugar monitoring monitoring your blood sugar is essential to finding out how well your current treatment plan is working. it gives you information on how to manage diabetes on a daily and sometimes even hourly basis. the results of blood sugar monitoring can help you make decisions about food, physical activity and dosing insulin. several things can affect your blood sugar. you can learn to predict some of these impacts with time and practice, while others are very difficult or impossible to predict. that’s why its important to check your blood sugar regularly if your healthcare provider recommends doing so. there are two main ways you can monitor your blood sugar at home if you have diabetes: with a glucose meter and finger stick. with a continuous glucose monitor (cgm). you may choose either or both methods for a variety of reasons, such as: your access to the technology, which can vary due to cost and medical insurance coverage. how often your healthcare provider recommends checking your blood sugar. the medications you’re taking. your overall health. type 2 diabetes medications your healthcare provider may recommend taking medication, in addition to lifestyle changes, to manage type 2 diabetes. these include: oral diabetes medications: these are medications that you take by mouth to help manage blood sugar levels in people who have t2d but still produce some insulin. there are several types. the most commonly prescribed one is metformin. your provider may prescribe more than one oral diabetes medication at a time to achieve the best blood glucose management. glp-1 and dual glp-1/gipagonists: these are injectable medications that mainly help manage blood sugar levels in people with t2d. some glp-1 agonists can also help treat obesity. insulin: synthetic insulin directly lowers blood sugar levels. there are several types of insulin, like long-acting and short-acting types. you may inject it with syringes or pens, use inhaled insulin, or use an insulin pump. other medications: you may take other medications to manage coexisting conditions, like high blood pressure and high cholesterol. can type 2 diabetes be reversed? type 2 diabetes is a chronic (long-term) disease, which means you must manage it for the rest of your life. there’s no cure for t2d. but you can manage it with lifestyle changes, medication and blood sugar monitoring in a way that keeps your blood sugar levels in a healthy range. if you stop managing it or undermanage it, your blood sugar levels will go back up. prevention can prevent type 2 diabetes? certain strategies can help lower your risk of developing type 2 diabetes or delay its onset, including: exercising regularly (at least 150 minutes a week). maintaining a weight that's healthy for you. eating nutritious food. not smoking. unfortunately, some people have such strong genetic risk factors that even lifestyle changes aren't enough to prevent developing t2d. outlook / prognosis what is the outlook for type 2 diabetes? if you have type 2 diabetes, your outlook depends on several factors, like: your age at diagnosis. how often and how well you’re able to keep your blood sugar levels in range. if you have other conditions, like high blood pressure or high cholesterol. your access to healthcare, diabetes management tools and medication, nutritious foods and support from loved ones. untreated or undermanaged t2d can lead to a range of health conditions. what are the complications of type 2 diabetes? as your blood touches virtually every part of your body, having undermanaged type 2 diabetes that results in continuous high blood sugar over a long period of time can damage several areas of your body. potential complications of type 2 diabetes include: cardiovascular disease, including: coronary artery disease (cad). peripheral artery disease (pad). cerebrovascular disease. heart attack. stroke. eye conditions, including: diabetes-related retinopathy. diabetes-related macular edema. cataracts. glaucoma. blindness. additional complications include: diabetes-related nephropathy (kidney disease). diabetes-related neuropathy (nerve damage). skin conditions, like dry skin and bacterial and fungal infections. foot problems, including ulcers and infections that can lead to gangrene and possible amputation. gum disease and other oral health problems. hearing loss. digestive problems, including gastroparesis. sexual dysfunction. short-term complications of t2d hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (hhs) is a life-threatening complication of type 2 diabetes. hhs happens when your blood sugar levels are too high for a long period, leading to severe dehydration and confusion. symptoms of hhs usually come on slowly and can take days or weeks to develop. symptoms include: very high blood sugar level (over 600 mg/d l). mental changes, such as confusion, delirium or experiencing hallucinations. loss of consciousness. dry mouth and extreme thirst. frequent urination. blurred vision or loss of vision. weakness or paralysis that may be worse on one side of your body. hhs is life-threatening and requires immediate medical treatment. if you experience these symptoms, call 911 or your local emergency services number. living with how do itake care of myself if i have type 2 diabetes? type 2 diabetes is a complex condition that requires daily management, effort and planning. some tips that can help you manage t2d include: try to stick to healthy lifestyle changes: regular exercise and healthy eating plans are core parts of t2d management. set small goals and make one change at a time to prevent becoming overwhelmed. check your blood sugar regularly checking your blood sugar with a fingerstick and meter and/or using a continuous glucose monitor (cgm) is crucial to managing diabetes and preventing complications. follow your providers guidance for how often you should be checking it. take your medication regularly: follow your healthcare providers instructions for taking your medications (if applicable). see your diabetes provider regularly: its important to see the provider who helps you manage t2d regularly to be sure that your management plan is working. don’t be afraid to ask them specific questions. see your other providers regularly, especially your eye doctor: type 2 diabetes can cause complications in various areas of your body, but especially your eyes. it’s important to see your eye doctor (ophthalmologist) at least yearly so that they can check the health of your eyes. have a sick day plan: talk with your diabetes provider about how to take care of yourself and manage t2d when you’re sick. illness can make it more difficult to manage blood sugar levels and can trigger hhs. stay educated: don’t be afraid to ask your provider questions about t2 d. the more you know about t2d and your management, the more likely you'll be able to live healthily and prevent complications. find community: connecting with other people who have t2d whether in-person or online can help you feel less alone. take care of your mental health: people with diabetes are two to three times more likely to have depression and are 20% more likely to be diagnosed with anxiety than those without diabetes. living with a chronic condition that requires constant care can be overwhelming. it's important to talk to a mental health professional if you're experiencing signs of depression and/or anxiety. when should i see my healthcare provider if i have type 2 diabetes? you’ll need to have regular appointments with your healthcare team to be sure you're on track with your t2d management plan. as your body, life and routines change, your management will need to, as well. your healthcare team can provide new strategies that are unique to your needs. if you develop symptoms of any diabetes complications, be sure to see your provider as soon as possible. a note from cleveland clinic type 2 diabetes involves constant day-to-day care and management. while it'll likely be very overwhelming at first, over time you'll get a better grasp on how to manage the condition and how to be in tune with your body.be sure to see your healthcare team regularly. managing type 2 diabetes involves a team effort you’ll want both medical professionals and friends and family on your side. don’t hesitate to reach out to them if you need help.
