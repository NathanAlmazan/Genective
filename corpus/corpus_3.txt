type 2 diabetes is a condition that happens because of a problem in the way the body regulates and uses sugar as a fuel. that sugar also is called glucose. this long-term condition results in too much sugar circulating in the blood. eventually, high blood sugar levels can lead to disorders of the circulatory, nervous and immune systems. in type 2 diabetes, there are primarily two problems. the pancreas does not produce enough insulin a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into the cells. and cells respond poorly to insulin and take in less sugar. type 2 diabetes used to be known as adult-onset diabetes, but both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can begin during childhood and adulthood. type 2 is more common in older adults. but the increase in the number of children with obesity has led to more cases of type 2 diabetes in younger people. there's no cure for type 2 diabetes. losing weight, eating well and exercising can help manage the disease. if diet and exercise aren't enough to control blood sugar, diabetes medications or insulin therapy may be recommended. symptoms symptoms of type 2 diabetes often develop slowly. in fact, you can be living with type 2 diabetes for years and not know it. when symptoms are present, they may include: - increased thirst: experiencing a persistent feeling of thirst, often accompanied by a need to drink larger amounts of water than usual. - frequent urination: having to urinate more often than usual, which may include waking up frequently during the night to urinate. - increased hunger: feeling hungry more frequently or having an increased appetite, sometimes even after eating. - unintended weight loss: losing weight without actively trying to do so, which may be a result of the body not properly utilizing glucose for energy. - fatigue: persistent feelings of tiredness and lack of energy, even with adequate rest. - blurred vision: experiencing blurry or distorted vision, which can be a result of changes in the fluid levels within the eyes due to high blood sugar. - slow-healing sores: wounds and sores taking longer to heal than usual, which is linked to reduced circulation and compromised immune function. - slow healing of wounds: similar to slow-healing sores, individuals with diabetes may experience delays in the healing of cuts, bruises, or other injuries. - frequent infections: increased susceptibility to infections, such as urinary tract infections, skin infections, and others, due to compromised immune function. - numbness or tingling in the hands or feet: peripheral neuropathy, a condition where nerve damage can lead to sensations of numbness, tingling, or pain in the extremities. - areas of darkened skin, usually in the armpits and neck: acanthosis nigricans, a condition characterized by dark, thickened, and velvety skin in certain areas, often associated with insulin resistance. risk factors - insulin resistance: the primary factor in type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance. the body's cells become resistant to the effects of insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar. as a result, the pancreas produces more insulin to compensate, but over time, it may not keep up with the increased demand. - genetics: there is a genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes, and having a family history of the condition increases the risk. - lifestyle factors: 1. obesity: excess body weight, especially around the abdomen, is a significant risk factor for type 2 diabetes. 2. physical inactivity: lack of regular physical activity is associated with an increased risk. 3. unhealthy diet: diets high in refined sugars, saturated fats, and processed foods can contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes. - age and ethnicity: the risk of type 2 diabetes increases with age, and certain ethnic groups, such as african americans, hispanics, native americans, and asian americans, are more prone to the condition. - obesity: obesity is a medical condition characterized by an excessive accumulation of body fat. it is often measured using the body mass index (bmi), with obesity defined as a bmi of 30 or higher. obesity is a significant risk factor for type 2 diabetes, as excess body fat can lead to insulin resistance. - sedentary lifestyle: a sedentary lifestyle refers to a pattern of living that involves little or no physical activity or exercise. lack of regular physical activity is associated with various health risks, including an increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. sedentary behavior may involve extended periods of sitting or low levels of physical movement. - family history: family history refers to the presence of a particular health condition, such as diabetes, among close biological relatives (parents, siblings). having a family history of diabetes can increase an individual's risk of developing the condition, suggesting a genetic predisposition. - age: age is a non-modifiable risk factor for type 2 diabetes. the risk of developing diabetes increases with age, particularly after the age of 45. this may be attributed to factors such as changes in metabolism, hormonal changes, and cumulative exposure to other risk factors over time. - ethnicity: ethnicity refers to the cultural and ancestral background of an individual. certain ethnic groups have a higher predisposition to type 2 diabetes. for example, african americans, hispanics, native americans, asian americans, and pacific islanders are at an increased risk compared to the general population. genetic factors and lifestyle patterns within specific ethnic communities contribute to these disparities. causes - genes: scientists have found different bits of dna that affect how your body makes insulin. - weight: having extra weight or obesity can cause insulin resistance. metabolic syndrome. people with insulin resistance often have a group of conditions including high blood sugar, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol and triglycerides. - too much glucose from your liver: when your blood sugar is low, your liver makes and sends out glucose. after you eat, your blood sugar goes up, and your liver usually slows down and stores its glucose for later. but some people's livers don't. they keep making sugar. - bad communication between cells: sometimes, cells send the wrong signals or don't pick up messages correctly. when these problems affect how your cells make and use insulin or glucose, this can lead to diabetes. - broken beta cells: if the cells that make insulin send it out at the wrong time, your blood sugar gets thrown off. high blood sugar can damage these cells, too. medical history and health: - insulin resistance: insulin resistance is a condition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar. it can lead to elevated blood glucose levels and is a precursor to type 2 diabetes. - prediabetes: prediabetes is a condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. individuals with prediabetes have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. - heart and blood vessel disease: heart and blood vessel diseases encompass a range of conditions affecting the cardiovascular system, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, and stroke. diabetes is a significant risk factor for these diseases. - high blood pressure: high blood pressure (hypertension) is a condition where the force of blood against the artery walls is consistently too high. it is a common risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and individuals with diabetes are at an increased risk. - low hdl ("good") cholesterol: hdl cholesterol is often referred to as "good" cholesterol as it helps remove other forms of cholesterol from the bloodstream. low levels of hdl cholesterol are associated with an increased risk of heart disease. - high triglycerides: triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood. high levels of triglycerides are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and they often accompany conditions like obesity and insulin resistance. - being overweight or having obesity: being overweight or having obesity is a condition where excess body fat accumulates, increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other health problems. - having a baby who weighed more than 9 pounds: giving birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds may be a risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes later in life. - gestational diabetes: gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. women who have had gestational diabetes are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. - polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos): pcos is a hormonal disorder common among women of reproductive age. it is associated with insulin resistance and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. - depression: depression is a mental health condition characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, and other emotional and physical symptoms. it may be linked to an increased risk of developing diabetes. lifestyle factors: - getting little or no exercise: lack of physical activity and a sedentary lifestyle are significant risk factors for type 2 diabetes. regular exercise helps improve insulin sensitivity and manage weight. - smoking: smoking is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including heart disease. individuals who smoke and have diabetes face an increased risk of complications. - stress: chronic stress can contribute to unhealthy lifestyle habits, such as overeating or not getting enough exercise, which may increase the risk of developing diabetes. - sleeping too little or too much: disruptions in sleep patterns, whether due to insufficient sleep or excessive sleep, can affect metabolism and insulin sensitivity, potentially contributing to diabetes risk. type 2 diabetes diagnosis and tests diagnosing type 2 diabetes typically involves a combination of clinical evaluation and laboratory tests. here are the common methods and tests used for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes: 1. symptoms and clinical evaluation: - symptoms: the presence of classic symptoms such as increased thirst, frequent urination, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and others may prompt further investigation. - medical history: the healthcare provider will review the patient's medical history, including family history of diabetes and other relevant factors. 2. fasting blood sugar test: - this test measures the blood glucose level after an overnight fast (usually at least 8 hours without eating or drinking anything except water). - diagnostic criteria: a fasting blood sugar level of 126 milligrams per deciliter (mg/d l) or higher on two separate occasions generally indicates diabetes. 3. oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt): -the ogttinvolves fasting overnight and then drinking a sugary solution. blood sugar levels are measured at intervals after consuming the solution. -diagnostic criteria: a blood sugar level of 200 mg/d lor higher two hours after drinking the solution is indicative of diabetes. 4. hemoglobin a1c test: - this test measures the average blood glucose level over the past two to three months by assessing the percentage of hemoglobin that is glycated (bound to glucose). - diagnostic criteria: an a1c level of 6.5% or higher is generally used for the diagnosis of diabetes. 5. random blood sugar test: - this test measures blood glucose levels at any time of the day, regardless of when the individual last ate. - diagnostic criteria: a random blood sugar level of 200 mg/dl or higher, along with diabetes symptoms, may indicate diabetes. 6. clinical guidelines and criteria: - world health organization (who): the who also offers criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes, including fasting glucose levels and oral glucose tolerance tests. 7. blood tests: - a1c (glycated hemoglobin) test: purpose: measures the average percentage of hemoglobin that is glycated (bound to glucose) over the past 2 or 3 months. procedure: a blood sample is taken, and the result is expressed as a percentage. an a1c level of 6.5% or higher is generally used for the diagnosis of diabetes. -fasting plasma glucose test: purpose: measures blood sugar levels after an overnight fast. procedure: the individual refrains from eating or drinking (except water) for at least 8 hours before the test. A blood sample is taken, and a fasting glucose level of 126 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) or higher on two separate occasions may indicate diabetes. - oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt): purpose: checks blood glucose levels before and 2 hours after consuming a sweetened beverage to evaluate how the body handles sugar. procedure: the individual drinks a sugary solution, and blood samples are taken before and after. a blood sugar level of 200 mg/dl or higher 2 hours after drinking the solution is indicative of diabetes. it's important to note that the diagnostic criteria and methods may vary slightly between different organizations and regions. additionally, the diagnosis is not solely based on a single test result; healthcare providers consider multiple factors, including the patient's overall health, risk factors, and symptoms. individuals at risk for type 2 diabetes, such as those with a family history or certain lifestyle factors, may undergo regular screenings to detect the condition early. early detection and management are crucial for preventing complications associated with diabetes. a healthcare professional will determine the most appropriate diagnostic approach based on the individual's circumstances. stages of type 2 diabetes 1. insulin resistance: description: in this initial stage, the body usually produces enough insulin to regulate blood sugar levels within the normal range. however, cells resist the effects of insulin, meaning they don't use it efficiently. as a result, the body compensates by producing more insulin to aid glucose entry into the cells. characteristics: insulin resistance may be temporary, but it can persist over time. there isn't a specific test to directly measure insulin resistance, making it challenging to diagnose this stage directly. 2. prediabetes: description: insulin resistance, if not addressed, leads to an accumulation of glucose in the blood. prediabetes is the stage where blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not elevated enough to be classified as diabetes. during this stage, individuals may not experience noticeable symptoms. diagnostic criteria: an a1c (glycated hemoglobin) level between 5.7% and 6.4% is indicative of prediabetes. this blood test provides an average of blood glucose levels over the past 2-3 months. implications of prediabetes: - individuals with prediabetes are at an increased risk for developing heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. - early intervention through lifestyle modifications, such as a healthy diet and regular physical activity, can help prevent the progression to type 2 diabetes. it's important to note that these stages represent a continuum, and the progression to type 2 diabetes is not inevitable. lifestyle changes, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and weight management, can play a crucial role in preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes in individuals with insulin resistance or prediabetes. regular health check-ups and screenings are important for early detection and intervention. type 2 diabetes treatment the treatment of type 2 diabetes involves a comprehensive approach that includes lifestyle changes and, in some cases, medication. here are the key components of type 2 diabetes treatment: 1. lifestyle changes: - weight loss: objective: achieving and maintaining a healthy weight. benefits: weight loss can improve insulin sensitivity and help regulate blood sugar levels. recommendation: losing at least 7% of body weight is considered beneficial. - healthy eating: objective: adopting a balanced and nutritious diet. guidance: work with a registered dietitian to learn about carbohydrates, create a meal plan, and focus on: eating fewer calories. reducing consumption of refined carbs, especially sweets. incorporating more vegetables and fruits into the diet. increasing fiber intake. - regular exercise: objective: engaging in regular physical activity. recommendation: aim for 30 to 60 minutes of exercise every day, which can include activities such as walking, biking, swimming, or other forms of aerobic exercise. strength training, like yoga or weightlifting, is also beneficial. note: check with your healthcare provider before starting a new exercise program, especially if you have other health concerns. - monitoring blood sugar levels: objective: regularly checking blood sugar levels to track the effectiveness of treatment. guidance: depending on your treatment plan, especially if you are on insulin, your doctor will provide instructions on how often to monitor blood sugar levels. - medication: purpose: medications may be prescribed to help manage blood sugar levels. - types of medications: - oral medications: these include various classes of drugs that help improve insulin sensitivity, reduce glucose production by the liver, and enhance glucose uptake by cells. - injectable medications: some people may require insulin injections or other injectable medications to control blood sugar. - regular medical check-ups: importance: regular visits to your healthcare provider are crucial to monitor overall health, adjust treatment plans as needed, and address any emerging issues. diabetes education: purpose: empower individuals with the knowledge and skills to manage their diabetes effectively. resources: diabetes education programs and support from healthcare professionals, including registered dietitians and diabetes educators. medication if lifestyle changes don’t get you to your target blood sugar levels, you may need medication. some of the most common for type 2 diabetes include: 1. metformin (fortamet, glucophage, glumetza, riomet). this is usually the first medication used to treat type 2 diabetes. it lowers the amount of glucose your liver makes and helps your body respond better to the insulin it does make. 2. sulfonylureas. this group of drugs helps your body make more insulin. they include glimepiride (amaryl), glipizide (glucotrol), and glyburide (dia beta, micronase). 3. meglitinides. they help your body make more insulin, and they work faster than sulfonylureas. you might take nateglinide (starlix) or repaglinide (prandin). 4. thiazolidinediones. like metformin, they make you more sensitive to insulin. you could get pioglitazone (actos) or rosiglitazone (avandia). but they also raise your risk of heart problems, so they aren't usually a first choice for treatment. 5. dpp-4 inhibitors. these medications -- linagliptin (tradjenta), saxagliptin (onglyza), and sitagliptin (januvia) -- help lower your blood sugar levels, but they can also cause joint pain and could inflame your pancreas. they work by blocking dpp-4, which is an enzyme that affects the hormone incretin. 6. glp-1 receptor agonists. you take these medications with a needle to slow digestion and lower blood sugar levels. some of the most common ones are exenatide (byetta, bydureon), liraglutide (victoza), and semaglutide (ozempic). 7. sglt2 inhibitors. these help your kidneys filter out more glucose. you might get bexagliflozin (brenzavvy), canagliflozin (invokana), dapagliflozin (farxiga), or empagliflozin (jardiance). empagliflozin has also proven effective in reducing the risk of hospitalization or death from heart failure. 8. gipand glp-1 receptor agonist. tirzepatide (mounjaro) is the first in its class and activates both the glp-1 and gipreceptors, which leads to improved blood sugar control. 9. insulin. you might take long-lasting shots at night, such as insulin detemir (levemir) or insulin glargine (lantus). complications 1. cardiovascular diseases: description: high blood sugar levels over time can lead to damage in the heart and blood vessels, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. specific risks: increased likelihood of heart disease or stroke. higher risk of blocked blood vessels (atherosclerosis). elevated risk of chest pain (angina). 2. nerve damage (neuropathy): description: prolonged exposure to high blood sugar can cause damage to the nerves throughout the body. specific risks: digestive issues. impaired feeling in the feet. sexual response problems. 3.

levels. replace low-fiber refined grains (e.g., white bread) with whole grains (e.g., whole wheat bread, brown rice). 4. prioritize non-starchy vegetables: include in every meal: boost your intake of non-starchy vegetables like broccoli, leafy greens, peppers, and green beans. these vegetables are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. 5. moderate portion sizes: portion control: be mindful of portion sizes to manage calorie intake and prevent overeating. use smaller plates to help control portions. 6. lean protein sources: choose lean proteins: include lean protein sources such as poultry, fish, tofu, legumes, and low-fat dairy in your diet. limit red and processed meats. 7. healthy fats: opt for healthy fats: choose sources of healthy fats, such as avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil. limit saturated and trans fats found in fried foods and processed snacks. 8. regular meal timing: establish consistent meal times: aim for regular meal timings to help regulate blood sugar levels. include snacks if needed, especially if taking medications that may cause low blood sugar. 9. stay hydrated: drink water: stay hydrated by drinking water throughout the day. limit sugary beverages and alcohol. 10. monitor blood sugar responses: test and analyze: regularly monitor blood sugar levels to understand how different foods impact your readings. adjust your diet based on your blood sugar responses. 11. individualized approach: personalize your plan: recognize that individual responses to foods can vary. tailor your diet to your specific needs and preferences. 12. regular review and adjustments: stay in touch with healthcare providers: regularly review your diet plan with healthcare providers and make adjustments as needed. managing type 2 diabetes managing your type 2 diabetes well helps you avoid complications and feel your best. along with a healthy diet, regular exercise, and medication as prescribed: 1. keep your blood pressure and cholesterol levels in the healthy range. high levels of either could raise your risk of diabetes complications. 2. get regular eye exams, dentist visits, and physicals. 3. check your feet daily for sores, redness, or swelling and let your doctor know if you notice any issues. 4. get at least 7 hours of good-quality sleep each night, as sleep loss interferes with blood sugar control. ask your doctor for help if you have a hard time sleeping. 5. be careful with alcohol. limit alcoholic drinks to 1-2 drinks a day, depending on your size and gender. if you do drink alcohol, check your blood sugar afterward. 6. work with your doctor to come up with a sick day plan. even a minor illness can interfere with your blood sugar and insulin levels. you may need to adjust your medications or check your blood sugar more often. type 2

factors impact glucose trends. limitations: - higher cost compared to traditional glucometers. - requires sensor insertion beneath the skin, which may be uncomfortable for some individuals. genetic factors type 2 diabetes has a complex etiology, and both genetic and environmental factors contribute to its development. genetic factors play a significant role in determining an individual's susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. here are some key aspects related to the genetic factors of type 2 diabetes: 1. family history: - inheritance: the risk of type 2 diabetes increases if there is a family history of the condition. individuals with a first-degree relative (parent or sibling) with type 2 diabetes are at a higher risk. - polygenic inheritance: multiple genes contribute to diabetes risk, and it often involves polygenic inheritance, meaning that several genes collectively influence susceptibility. 2. genetic variants and mutations: - common variants: there are common genetic variants associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. these variants are often identified through genome-wide association studies (gwas). - rare mutations: in some cases, rare mutations in specific genes can significantly increase the risk of diabetes. examples include mutations in the hnf1 a and hnf4 a genes. 3. insulin resistance and beta cell function: - genes influencing insulin sensitivity: genetic factors can impact insulin sensitivity, affecting how effectively cells respond to insulin. variations in genes like tcf7 l2 are associated with insulin resistance. - beta cell function genes: genes involved in the function of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, such as those encoding for proinsulin processing, can influence diabetes risk. 4. epigenetic modifications: - environmental influence on gene expression: epigenetic modifications, such as dna methylation and histone modification, can influence how genes related to glucose metabolism are expressed. - lifestyle and environmental factors: environmental factors, including diet and lifestyle, can interact with genetic factors and contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes. 5. interaction with lifestyle factors: - gene-environment interaction: genetic factors interact with lifestyle and environmental factors, such as diet, physical activity, and obesity, influencing the overall risk of type 2 diabetes. - obesity-related genes: some genes are associated with an increased risk of obesity, which is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. 6. mitochondrial dna: - mitochondrial involvement: mitochondria, the energy-producing structures in cells, have their own dna. variations in mitochondrial dna have been studied in relation to type 2 diabetes. 7. ethnic and racial differences: - population-specific variations: there are ethnic and racial differences in the prevalence of certain genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes. different populations may have unique genetic risk profiles. 8. genetic testing: - risk prediction: genetic testing can provide information about an individual's genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. however, it's important to note that genetic testing is only one aspect of overall risk assessment, and lifestyle factors also play a significant role.
